	-- [tod 2026-08-23] ALL NINE ICONS ARE OURS NOW — the Grunge BO2-Style set the
	-- user supplied, installed through the i_tod_perk_* lane (PNG in
	-- source_data/tod_ui_images/_images/, block in tod_ui_images.gdt, image, line
	-- in zm_tod2_cybercity.zone). One pack, one style, nine icons, which is what
	-- the user asked for after two earlier attempts each covered only part of the
	-- roster (the West pack is for CUSTOM perks and overlapped ours on one entry;
	-- the Aetherium kit ships no Double Tap 2, Widow's Wine or Electric Cherry).
	--
	-- WHY WE STOPPED USING THE STOCK specialty_*_zombies NAMES: seven of them
	-- resolve on a usermap and one does not. specialty_extraprimaryweapon_zombies
	-- (Mule Kick) is ABSENT from <TOOLS>/zone_source/all/assetlist/zm_levelcommon.csv
	-- — the common list every map inherits — so it drew a WHITE SQUARE in the
	-- shipped build, and it cannot be zoned because the asset does not exist to
	-- pack. Shipping our own art was the only fix for that one, and once one icon
	-- had to be custom, a full consistent set beat a 7+1+1 patchwork.
	--
	-- THE DIAGNOSTIC, if an icon ever goes white again: grep that assetlist for
	-- the name. In it -> renders. Absent -> white square. Do NOT guess which perks
	-- are "DLC"; two sessions guessed and both guessed wrong (the real radius was
	-- ONE, not four). Every name below is one of ours and every one is zoned.

		--      register_perk_clientfields on the belief that the HUD reads the
		--      specialty natively. It does not — zm_perks::set_perk_clientfield
		--      (_zm_perks.gsc:968) is a NO-OP without a registered clientfield_set,
		--      and this container reads hudItems.perks.<clientFieldName> and never
		--      looks at `specialty` at all. The perk now registers a set func.
		--   2. "combat_efficiency" IS NOT A REGISTERED UIMODEL. It matched the
		--      perk's specialty, which reads well, but no clientuimodel field of
		--      that name exists in either VM, so writing it would have gone
		--      nowhere even once something tried.
		--
		-- clientFieldName is now MULE KICK's field. That looks wrong and is not:
		-- registering a new clientuimodel needs a matched append in BOTH VMs and
		-- this map has a documented boot ceiling on that pool (61 bits proven;
		-- we are at 58). additional_primary_weapon is already registered in both
		-- VMs by _zm_perk_additionalprimaryweapon, and Mule Kick was RETIRED from
		-- this map on 2026-08-25 when PhD replaced it — so the field is allocated,
		-- matched, free, and written by nothing else. Zero new bits.
