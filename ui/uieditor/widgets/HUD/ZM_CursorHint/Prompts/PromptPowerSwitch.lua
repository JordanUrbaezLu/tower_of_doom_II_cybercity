-- =============================================================================
-- PromptPowerSwitch.lua — the base power switch.
--
-- v19.3: REBUILT ON CoD.TodPromptCard. Everything this file used to draw by
-- hand — five chassis rects, the icon, the title, the description, the footer —
-- now comes from the one shared owner, so this card's LOOK is no longer this
-- card's business. See TodPromptCard.lua's header for why.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED FOR THE PLAYER, and both were real faults the user found in
-- two minutes of play:
--
--   1. THE TYPEFACE. The title was orbitron and the description ltromatic —
--      the vendored kit's two fonts. Three feet away the ammo crate was drawing
--      the map's own letters. Now both are the map's typeface, which is also
--      uppercase by construction, so the case is right without anyone policing
--      the source string.
--
--   2. THE COPY. The description read *"Powers various things around the map"*
--      — kit filler that was never written about this map and tells a player
--      nothing they can act on. It now names what power actually unlocks here.
