-- =============================================================================
-- TodPromptCard.lua — THE ONE OWNER OF EVERY CURSOR-HINT PROMPT CARD.
--
-- USER, 2026-09-14, after two minutes of play: *"the teleport bay, the power
-- switch — these don't even use the correct typography ... we should only have
-- to do this in one area in the HUD, and it applies to all prompts. It
-- shouldn't be a situation where we need to switch each one one by one."*
-- And then: *"there shouldn't be situations where we see half work and half
-- life ... You should completely take that out and implement the new way."*
--
-- Both are answered here. Before this file the map had SIX prompt cards, each
-- an independent copy of the same chassis, the same five background rects, the
-- same title/detail/price boxes and the same footer — six places to fix a font,
-- six places to fix a colour, six places to fix a word. v19.1 reskinned the
-- art in all six and v19.2 converted the typeface in ONE, which is exactly the
-- half-and-half state the user is objecting to: the ammo crate drew the map's
-- letters and the power switch three feet away drew the kit's.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, AND THEREFORE WHAT A CARD NO LONGER DECIDES
--
--   * the chassis        — all five nested rects and the one art image
--   * the icon well      — and the hint -> icon table, which used to be local
--                          to PromptDefault, so five cards could not use it
--   * the typeface       — every letter on every card, via CoD.TodGlyphText
--   * the boxes          — title / detail 1 / detail 2 / price / footer
--   * the footer         — "HOLD <key> TO <verb>" including the device split
--   * the price lockup   — the coin and the digits beside it
--
-- A card file is now a THIN SHELL: it calls Build() once and then pushes
-- strings in through SetTitle / SetDetail / SetPrice / SetIcon / SetFooter.
-- It owns only its own parsing — which is the one thing that genuinely differs
-- between a door, a perk machine and a Pack-a-Punch.
--
-- ⚠️ THE RULE FROM HERE: NO PROMPT CARD MAY CALL setTTF, LUI.UIText.new OR
-- setImage FOR CHASSIS ART. If a card needs something this file cannot give it,
-- ADD IT HERE. tools/lint_tod_lua.js gates the setTTF half of that.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE TYPEFACE IS UPPERCASE BY CONSTRUCTION, AND THAT IS A FEATURE HERE.
--
-- CoD.TodGlyphText's cleaner runs string.upper() on everything (TodGlyphText
-- .lua:76) because the baked sheet has 42 glyphs and no lowercase. So the whole
-- class of complaint the user opened with — *"it's the teleport bay without
-- capital t"*, *"the Spiral Tower 41 is not capitalized"* — cannot survive this
-- conversion regardless of how the source string was written. The GSC strings
-- are still being corrected at source (a hint is also read by the hint lint and
-- by anyone maintaining it), but the SCREEN is fixed by construction the moment
-- a card routes through here.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE FOOTER IS THE ONE PLACE AN ENGINE-DRAWN THING SURVIVES, ON PURPOSE.
--
-- The footer reads "HOLD <key> TO USE". HOLD and TO USE are ours. The <key> is
-- NOT typography — it is whatever the player's device is bound to, and on a pad
-- the engine substitutes a CONTROLLER BUTTON PICTURE. We do not draw that
-- ourselves for the same reason we do not draw the player's keyboard layout:
-- it has to match the controller actually in their hands.
--
-- ONE element carries the token and the ENGINE substitutes it: a key name on a
-- keyboard, a button PICTURE on a pad. There is no device branch here, because
-- the engine has already made that decision by the time the line is set. It is
-- the only non-TodGlyphText text on any prompt card, and it never draws copy we
-- wrote — only the player's own bind.
--
-- See memory `bind-token-is-never-a-string`: the engine has ALREADY resolved
-- [{+activate}] before hudItems.cursorHintText reaches Lua, so nothing here may
-- test for the literal token.

	-- inner bottom frame at 516.6, so the band the footer belongs in is
	-- 501.1..516.6. This box is centred in it: baseline 512.6, caps from 505.1.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THESE NUMBERS ARE WHAT THEY ARE (v19.7 — user, after seeing v19.5 in
-- game: *"lets cut the size increase we did on everything by 65%. I think it's
-- too big."*  v19.5 had answered the opposite complaint: *"there's always a ton
-- of empty space under the description, and the text is very small ... maybe
-- twenty five percent bigger."*)
--
-- A glyph row's size comes from its BOX HEIGHT (`cap = h * capFrac`, capFrac
-- 0.80), so the box IS the type size and there is no separate font number to
-- chase. Every height here is `v19.3 + 0.35 * (v19.5 - v19.3)` — exactly 35% of
-- the growth that shipped, kept as fractions because this is the 1280x720
-- virtual canvas and rounding 448.3 to 448 would have made the cut 75% on that
-- row instead of 65%.
--
--     row      v19.3  v19.5  v19.7   |  drawn cap
--     title      10     14    11.4   |  8.00 -> 11.20 -> 9.12
--     detail      7     11     8.4   |  5.60 ->  8.80 -> 6.72
--     footer      8     12     9.4   |  6.40 ->  9.60 -> 7.52
--     price       9     13    10.4   |  7.20 -> 10.40 -> 8.32
--
-- ⚠️ THE DEAD BAND IS THE ONE THING NOT INTERPOLATED BACK, ON PURPOSE. The
-- "ton of empty space under the description" is a complaint that still stands;
-- interpolating the footer's POSITION would have returned 8 of those 22 units
-- to the screen while nobody asked for them. So the footer keeps the v19.5 lift
-- and takes only the size cut, and the 6.5 units the shrink frees are split
-- evenly above and below it — dead band 9 -> 12.25, bottom margin 6 -> 9.25.
-- Against v19.3's 22-unit hole that is still less than half.
--
-- ⚠️ THE FOOTER VERB IS WIDTH-BOUND AND BARELY MOVES — EXPECTED, NOT A MISS.
-- The whole bottom row is 620..773 = 153 units and must hold "HOLD <key> TO
-- UPGRADE" AND a price, so TodGlyphText's own fit already clamps a long verb on
-- WIDTH (~cap 4.7) and a height change cannot reach it. "HOLD" is the piece that
-- is height-bound, which is why FOOT_HOLD_W comes down with it.

-- Pools are the MAXIMUM glyph count each row can draw. A glyph row pre-creates
-- its cells, so this is an allocation, not a limit to tune per string.
-- v19.14 — POOL_DESC 34 -> 40. ⚠️ A GLYPH POOL IS A HARD CHARACTER LIMIT, AND
-- IT CLIPS SILENTLY: TodGlyphText draws until the pool runs out and simply stops.
-- Quick Revive's two lines are 35 and 37 characters and BOTH came back cut at
-- exactly 34 ("...YOURSELF 3 TIME", "...TEAMMATES FAS"), which reads as a card
-- too narrow for its copy and is nothing of the kind — rendering those exact
-- strings through tmp/render_card.py over the real chassis shows them fitting
-- the 147-unit box with room to spare, because the row SHRINKS ITS CAP to fit
-- the width. Width was never the constraint. THE COUNT WAS.
--
-- SO: WHEN COPY TRUNCATES ON A CARD, COUNT THE CHARACTERS BEFORE RESIZING
-- ANYTHING. A clip at a round number is a pool, not a box.
--
-- 40 rather than 50: each row costs one LUI element per slot and every card
-- carries two of them, so this is ~120 elements across the prompt set. That is
-- paid once at construction and released by TodUIOwnership, but it is not free,
-- and the element pool is the very thing tonight's crash work was about.

	-- cause: the coin was a SEPARATE UIImage in its own 15x12 box beside a text
	-- box, so its size and its baseline were hand-numbers that had to be kept
	-- agreeing with a font. They were not agreeing. And it looked tiny because
	-- i_tod_hud_points_icon.png carries transparent padding — the 15x12 box was
	-- mostly empty, so the visible coin was far smaller than the digits.
	--
	-- THE FIX IS NOT A NUDGE. v19.2 put the HUD's own money symbol into the
	-- typeface as "$" (the dead ampersand cell), so the price can be ONE STRING
	-- in ONE row: "$2500". The symbol now takes the digits' exact cap height and
	-- sits on the digits' exact baseline BY CONSTRUCTION — there is no second
	-- number left to drift, at any resolution.
	--
	-- RIGHT-ALIGNED to the card edge so the price always ends in the same place

	-- running left into the footer verb sharing this line.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE FOOTER, and the device split.
--
-- Layout: [HOLD] [key] [TO <VERB>]. The key's width is not ours to know — a pad
-- picture, "F", "MOUSE3" and "SPACE" all differ — so the verb is placed AFTER a
-- fixed key slot rather than flowed, which is the only arrangement that can
-- never overlap in a LUI with no measure API for engine text.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE FOOTER, AND THE KEY THAT WENT MISSING.
--
-- ⚠️ v19.5 REGRESSION FIX, AND THE REGRESSION WAS MINE. v19.3 drew the key
-- through `CoD.TodKeycap` — the widget that renders a bind inside the pale
-- keycap art for the class draft and the pause legend. On a prompt card it drew
-- NOTHING, so every prompt in the map read "HOLD      TO BUY" with a hole where
-- the key belongs. The user, correctly: *"this should already be taken care of.
-- The other had this figured out ... We shouldn't be messing up something like
-- this."* They are right: v14.58 through v19.2 had it working.
--
-- WHY IT DREW NOTHING: `kc.paint` falls back to a LUI text whenever the
-- measured string will not fit its pool or has no cell, and `make( owner,
-- fallbackText )` was handed a NIL fallback here — so every failure path drew
-- silently empty. That widget also expects the cap ART drawn behind it by the
-- caller, which a prompt footer has no room for. It was the wrong component.
--
-- WHAT IT IS NOW, and what already worked before v19.3: ONE element holding the
-- `[{+activate}]` token, which the ENGINE expands into whatever this player's
-- device is bound to — a key name on a keyboard, a button PICTURE on a pad. It
-- cannot come back blank, it needs no device branch, and it is correct again
-- after a rebind. It is not typography, so it is not in our 42-glyph set; the
-- HOLD and the verb around it are.
--
-- DO NOT rebuild a device branch here. The engine has already made that call by
-- the time we set the line (memory `bind-token-is-never-a-string`).
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (7.52), not guessed: "HOLD" comes to 23.2, so 24 is the smallest box that

-- 13 wide beside a default keyboard bind of one character — eight of those

-- LAYOUT THE FOOTER LINE — the ONE place its widths and its cap are decided.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS (v19.8, user: *"your footer is the main issue"*). The footer
-- is THREE elements on one line, and TodGlyphText fits each row to its OWN box.
-- "TO ACTIVATE" wants 60.7 units and had 40.6, so it clamped to cap 4.56 —
-- while "HOLD" next to it, which fits its box easily, drew at 7.52. One line,
-- two type sizes, and the bigger word was the throwaway one.
--
-- So the verb is MEASURED here, before anything draws, and whatever cap it can
-- actually have is pushed into BOTH rows. They already shared a baseline (same
-- box top and bottom); now they share a size, and the line shrinks as a unit or
-- not at all.
--
-- THE RIGHT EDGE IS CONDITIONAL because the price shares this row. With a price
-- the verb must stop at footR; without one it runs to the card's inner edge,
-- and "TO ACTIVATE" — the longest verb in the map, on the power switch, which
-- has no price — then fits at full size with room to spare.

-- SANITIZE — THE SAFETY NET FOR A 42-GLYPH TYPEFACE.
--
-- ⚠️ THE RISK THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. CoD.TodGlyphText's cleaner DROPS any
-- character with no cell, silently. The set is A-Z, 0-9, space, hyphen,
-- apostrophe, full stop and the money symbol — and nothing else. So a string
-- written for a TTF degrades in the worst possible way: it does not error, it
-- does not show a box, it just fuses the words either side of the missing mark.
--
-- Measured on the live perk table before this was written, `( ) , / : ;` all
-- appear in strings that now route through the typeface, e.g.
--   "Faster revives in co-op / Self-revive up to 3 times in solo"
-- would have drawn as "...IN CO-OP SELF-REVIVE UP TO..." with the divider gone
-- and the two clauses run together.
--
-- So every mark we know how to say WITHOUT a glyph is converted to one we have,
-- here, in the one place every card's text passes through. Anything still
-- unmapped is left to the cleaner — this is a net, not a licence to write copy
-- that needs punctuation we do not own.

-- that"*). Quick Revive states a solo price, a co-op price and what each does,
-- which is more than any other prompt carries.
--
-- ⚠️ THE ART IS 9-SLICED, NOT STRETCHED. `i_tod_prompt_chassis_wide` is the
-- same PNG with only its MIDDLE columns resampled (left 300 px and right 44 px
-- copied verbatim), so the rounded corners, the border and the icon well keep
-- their exact shape and the card simply grows a wider body. Stretching the
-- whole image to 1.3x would have flattened every corner into an ellipse, which
-- is the kind of "fix" that produces the next screenshot.
--
-- BOTH PNGs ARE 4 px PER CANVAS UNIT, so the widened art is 277 px = 69.25
-- units broader and the card's LEFT EDGE moves out by exactly that. Everything
-- anchored to the left edge (the well, the icon, every text column) moves with
