-- =============================================================================
-- PromptPerks.lua — the nine perk vending machines.
--
-- v19.3: REBUILT ON CoD.TodPromptCard. Chassis, typeface, footer and price all
-- come from the shared owner; this file keeps the perk lookup and the price
-- read, which are genuinely its own.
--
-- ⚠️ DO NOT REINTRODUCE AN INDEPENDENT PRICE GUESS. `HintCost()` below is the
-- v18.99l fix and it is load-bearing: the card used to infer solo/co-op from
-- the `tod_party` dvar and displayed 1500 while the server charged 500. The
-- machine's own hint carries the price. Read it; never recompute it.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE REWRITTEN HERE INSTEAD OF IN AetheriumPerks.lua
--
-- The shared perk table's descriptions are written for a TTF surface with room
-- to breathe — "Faster revives in co-op / Self-revive up to 3 times in solo",
-- 59 characters with a slash in it. Two things break when that is poured into
-- a prompt card:
--
--   1. THE GLYPH SET. `( ) , / : ;` all appear in that table and NONE of them
--      exist in the map's 42-glyph typeface. TodPromptCard.Sanitize now
--      converts what it can, but a sentence that needs a slash to make sense
--      is a sentence written for a different surface.
--   2. THE ROOM. The detail row holds 34 glyphs before it shrinks toward
--      unreadable. Those strings are up to 83.
--
-- So the prompt card gets its own short forms, two lines where a perk really
-- needs two. The long copy stays untouched for the perks container HUD, which
-- has the space and the font for it — changing it there would have degraded a
-- screen nobody complained about.
