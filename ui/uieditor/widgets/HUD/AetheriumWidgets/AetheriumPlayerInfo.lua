-- THE TYPEFACE (v17.34, user 2026-09-04: "changing all the text on screen to
-- use our alphabet ... the text on Left that shows players name and HP").
--
-- The three readouts on this panel -- NAME, HP and POINTS -- were UIText in
-- orbitron/ltromatic. They are now CoD.TodGlyphText, which draws the same
-- strings out of the baked glyph sheets the gun HUD and the ROUND counter use.
-- The constructor takes the SAME box the UIText had, and every existing
-- setText / setRGB / setAlpha call site below is unchanged: that is the whole
-- reason the element mimics the UIText surface.
--
-- ONE BOX DID MOVE. The name was 90..200 and the HP readout is 168..220, i.e.
-- they overlapped by 32px and only stayed apart because a short name in a
-- left-aligned UIText never reached that far. The glyph row FITS its string to
-- its box, so a long name would have grown into the HP text instead of
-- shrinking. The name box now ends at 164, four pixels clear of the HP box.
-- =============================================================================


-- TEMPORARY (v17.5, 2026-09-03): replaces the player NAME with the raw numbers
-- behind the HP readout, to settle a reported "3 HP" beside a ~60%-full bar.
-- Set false / delete this and its one use below once the cause is known.

	--
	-- The v16.98 plate (i_tod_hud_player_plate, one build old) drew the frame,
	-- the square portrait bay and the dark readout slab. All three go. What is
	-- left is five free-floating readouts anchored bottom-left, in a 226 x 60
	-- canvas box (x 24..250, y 618..678) — about a THIRD the area the panel

					-- two disagree and static reading did not explain it.
					--
					-- RULED OUT ON PAPER, so do not re-check these: the d[1]
					-- notify index matches every other reader in the tree and
					-- the kit; ints below 2^24 survive the lane intact so 150
					-- is safe; nothing in scripts/ sets .maxhealth below 150
					-- (max_hp_floor is 150 + vitality); and god mode floors
					-- health at 1 without touching maxhealth.
					--
					-- WHAT IS LEFT is a disagreement between the two consumers
					-- of the SAME model value: the text uses `health` as a
					-- NUMBER, while the bar feeds it through
					-- GetVectorComponentFromString as a VECTOR STRING. If the
					-- model carries "0.62 0 0 0" the bar is right and the text
					-- is arithmetic on a coerced string; if it carries a plain
					-- float they should agree and something else is wrong.
					-- This prints both interpretations plus maxHealth so the
					-- next run says which, instead of another round of theory.
					-- ⚠️ v17.34: this lane now draws through the GLYPH cleaner,
					-- which keeps only A-Z 0-9 and - ' . — so every "=" below is
					-- silently dropped and the readout comes out as
					-- "RAW0.62 VEC10.62 MAX150". Legible, but if this is ever

					-- LUI.UIText of its own.
