-- TodGlyphText — a UIText-shaped element that draws in the map's own typeface.
--
-- v17.34 (user 2026-09-04): "Can you look into changing all the text on screen
-- to use our alphabet? Mainly looking at the text on Left that shows players
-- name and HP and the our damage numbers and points gain that show up and
-- displayed at center of screen. Can we change all of that to use the alphabet
-- we created and numbers. Our typography."
--
-- WHY A SECOND LAYER OVER TodGlyphRow. The row factory is the right primitive
-- for the two readouts that already used it (the gun HUD, the ROUND counter):
-- both are ONE string, authored at an exact cap, right-aligned to an exact
-- edge, and they hand-place it. The readouts this file exists for are not like
-- that. There are ELEVEN of them, they were UIText elements living inside boxes
-- other code positions (the party rows compute their y from a row index), some
-- are LEFT aligned and one is CENTRED, they carry live values of unknown width,
-- and three of them carry a PLAYER NAME, which is arbitrary user data.
--
-- Hand-placing eleven caps and eleven baselines would have been eleven pairs of
-- numbers to keep in step with boxes that already exist and already move. So
-- this element takes THE BOX -- the same four numbers the UIText it replaces
-- was given -- and derives the cap, the baseline and the alignment from it.
-- Move the box and the text follows; there is no second set of coordinates.
--
-- WHAT A CALLER GETS -- deliberately the UIText surface, so a conversion is a
-- constructor swap and nothing else:
--   :setText( s )      any type; numbers are fine (Engine.Localize returns them)
--   :getText()         the RAW string last set, not the cleaned one
--   :setRGB( r,g,b )
--   :setAlpha( a )     inherited; LUI multiplies it down onto the glyphs, which
--                      is what lets the kill feed keep fading its rows
--   :setBox( l,r,t,b ) move/resize later
--
-- THE TYPEFACE IS CAPS-ONLY AND HAS 42 GLYPHS. A-Z, 0-9, and - ' . / + -- and
-- the last two live ONLY on the digit sheet while ' and . live only on the
-- letter sheet, so the cleaner is SET-AWARE. Feeding "+" through the name set
-- would route it to the letter sheet, find nothing, and blank the whole string.
--
-- A PLAYER NAME IS NOT OUR TEXT. Steam names carry emoji, Cyrillic, CJK and
-- symbols we will never bake. Unrenderable characters are dropped, and if that
-- leaves NOTHING the element falls back to a real TTF UIText with the original
-- string in it -- visible and in the wrong typeface, rather than invisible.
-- Only the three name readouts ask for that lane; every number readout has full
-- glyph coverage by construction and carries no fallback element at all.

require( "ui.uieditor.widgets.HUD.AetheriumWidgets.TodGlyphRow" )

-- Cap height as a fraction of the box height, and the baseline as a fraction of
-- it. A 12px box therefore draws a 9.6px cap sitting on y11.3, which leaves the
-- descender room the sheets expect (both cells carry 5-8% below the baseline).
-- Per-instance overrides exist (opts.capFrac / opts.cap / opts.baseFrac); these
-- are what a readout gets unless it says otherwise.

-- The glyphs that exist, per sheet. NOT a style choice -- this is the inventory
-- in TodGlyphMetrics, and asking for anything outside it blanks the string.
-- v19.2: "$" joins the renderable set -- it is the points icon in cell 28.
-- WITHOUT THIS LINE the cleaner would silently DROP every "$" and a price
-- would read "2500" with no symbol at all.

-- Uppercase, drop what we cannot draw, collapse the whitespace that dropping
-- leaves behind. `_` becomes `-` because it is the one substitution that is
-- obviously right in a player name; everything else is simply gone.
--
-- BUILT WITH `..`, NOT table.concat, and that is not a style preference: this
-- file loads inside AetheriumHud, which is NOT fail-safed (only tod_upgrade.lua
-- pcalls its requires), so an unavailable global here takes the WHOLE HUD down
-- at load. `string.upper/find/gsub/sub` are all proven in AetheriumLoadout.lua
-- in this same menu; `table.concat` is used nowhere in ui/, and a 32-character
-- string is not worth spending an unproven global on.
