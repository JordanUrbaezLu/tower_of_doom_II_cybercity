-- [tod v17.24] the ONE writer for a bind name inside the pale keycap — the fit
-- rule, the multi-bind trim and the cap's measured face geometry all live there,
-- shared with tod_upgrade.lua and the pause legend. See its header.
--
-- [tod v17.30] AND IT IS FAIL-SAFED, because a bare `require` is a way to lose
-- this whole menu. A require that throws — the rawfile missing from the .ff, a
-- Lua error inside the widget, or inside TodGlyphRow beneath it — aborts THIS
-- ENTIRE FILE, and a LUI failure is SILENT (no build complaint, no crash, just
-- nothing on screen). The class draft would never appear and every player would
-- be handed a random class on the 30 s timeout, with no way to tell why.
--
-- So: pcall the require, and route every call site through TodKeycapMake, which
-- degrades to the plain LUI text this menu already builds. THE STUB IS
-- DELIBERATELY LOCAL AND TWINNED across the three menus that use the widget — a
-- fail-safe that lives inside the thing it guards against is not a fail-safe,
-- and that is the one case where a twin beats a shared file.

-- their control set — user: *"Where is the KBM controls. All i see are
-- controller controls"*. Control characters prove nothing; only the HIGH range
-- can carry a button picture, since a keyboard key display name (SPACE, F,

--
-- It now answers ONE question — "may this string be drawn inside a keycap?" —
-- and is consulted only AFTER the baked typeface has failed to draw it. A key
-- name our own sheets can render never reaches it, which is what makes it
-- unable to turn a working keyboard into a controller whatever bytes come back.

-- [tod v18.32] THE HOLD PLATE, MEASURED OFF ITS OWN PIXELS.
--
-- `i_tod_hold_plate` is 460x70 and carries "HOLD" and "TO LOCK" as BAKED
-- lettering with a deliberate empty gap between them for the button. Decoding
-- the PNG: bright ink runs x96..401, the gap is x169..286 (118 wide, centred at
-- 227.5 — two and a half pixels LEFT of the plate's own centre), and the
-- lettering band is y25..42. `i_tod_hint_frame` and `i_tod_hint_locked` are the
-- same 460x70 sheet size.
--
-- WHY FRACTIONS. Two bugs in the 2026-09-08 screenshots came from typing pixel
-- literals for a plate whose drawn size had moved underneath them:
--
--   * THE PLATE WAS STRETCHED. It is drawn at xLo+5..xHi-5, which was 200 wide
--     when a class card was 210. A five-card draft made the card 186, the plate 176 —
--     and the height stayed 34, so 176/34 = 5.18 against the art's 6.571. Every
--     plate on this menu was ~27% too tall. THE RULE IS width = height *
--     PLATE_ASPECT, and it must be derived, never re-typed. (tod_upgrade.lua
--     learned this in v16.4 and wrote the rule down; this menu never got it.)
--
--   * THE GLYPH DID NOT FIT THE GAP. The keycap was a literal 60 px wide. At a
--     176-wide plate the gap is 176 * 0.2565 = 45 px, so the cap overhung the
--     baked "HOLD" and "TO LOCK" by ~7 px each side — which is exactly what the
--     screenshot shows, on the pad glyph and the keyboard cap alike.
--
-- Both are now arithmetic off these four numbers. Re-measure only if the plate
-- art is re-baked.

-- completely removed"* — and, decisively: *"It's not that I don't want right
-- trigger left trigger to be able to use for controller. I just don't want the
-- UI to say that."* So LT/RT keep WORKING; they may never be DRAWN.
--
-- WHY v17.55 DID NOT CLOSE IT. That pass put the device read in
-- CoD.TodKeycap.PadDevice() and had every surface call it. Correct, but it is
-- reached through `CoD.TodKeycap ~= nil and ...` — and this menu deliberately
-- pcall-requires that widget, so if the require ever fails the whole test
-- silently returns FALSE. A pad player then gets the KEYBOARD layout, and the
-- engine fills those caps with the pad's own words: LT / RT. The guard for the
-- third set lived inside the thing whose absence causes the third set.
--
-- So the test is twinned HERE, with no dependency on the widget — the same

-- makes; that copy stays the canonical one. Keep them in step.

-- what three passes of lexical matching could not: the engine expands a pad
-- bind into a BUTTON ICON, not the letters "LT". No path in this file draws a
-- pad image and a keycap together, so the icon in that shot came out of the
-- expansion, through the keycap's own text fallback. Matching on spelling was
-- always going to miss it.
--
-- TodPadGlyph is the structural test — see CoD.TodKeycap.IsPadGlyph, which is
-- the canonical copy and carries the whole argument. Keep the two in step.
