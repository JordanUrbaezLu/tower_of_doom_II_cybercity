// =============================================================================
// _tod_reaver.gsc — THE REAVER: elite #2 of the breather-door unlock ladder
// (docs/28). An Apothicon Fury (HB21 pack, already installed for map 1) driven
// as a TOWER ELITE — lighter than the Panzer, additive to the horde, unlocked
// by buying the LAP 20 breather door.
//
// WHY THIS ENEMY (docs/28 §1.2): it is the ONLY fully-formed unused AI on this
// machine. `<TOOLS>\share\raw\behavior\` ships eleven behaviour trees total and
// every other one is either already in use (mechz = Panzer, zod_robot_companion
// = Rogue Protector), a plain zombie, or a brain with no body (zm_avogadro has
// BT + ASM + animtables but its character GDT is gone). Margwa/thrasher/
// direwolf/riotshield have archetype SCRIPTS in share\raw and nothing else.
//
// THE VERB — it erases distance. Everything else on this map has to take the
// stairs behind you; the Reaver BAMFS: a 400–750u instant dash onto its enemy
// every ~4.5–6s. It is NOT a free teleport — the archetype demands mutual 50°
// FOV, both endpoints on the navmesh, a clear `TracePassedOnNavMesh` between
// them AND a successful `FindPath` (archetype_apothicon_fury.gsc:825). On a
// spiral that gates it by construction: a player one flight up has no straight
// navmesh line, so it CANNOT bamf through floors and needs no z-clamp of ours
// (contrast TOD_BOSS_FIRE_ZDELTA, which the ranged bosses do need). What it
// means in play: on the long straight flights and the open breather balconies
// you cannot hold a gap.
//
// SPAWN MECHANISM: the pack's own entry points, NOT a bare SpawnActor —
// `apothicon_fury_meteor_fx()` (sky meteor + ground tell, blocks ~1.5s) then
// `apothicon_fury_spawn()`. That path is map 1's proven one and it carries the
// archetype spawn funcs, so the Reaver arrives with behaviour instead of the
// "attacks but never walks" failure a direct SpawnActor causes.
//
// TRAPS HONOURED (each one already cost the sister map a session):
//  - ignore_enemy_count MUST be set the SAME FRAME as the spawn, never inside
//    the threaded tune (the pack spawns it is_zombie=1; a Reaver alive after
//    the horde clears otherwise counts toward the round).
//  - The pack threads apothicon_fury_health_init() — our HP set has to land
//    AFTER it or the pack's 1.2/1.5/1.7 round tier wins. Hence the wait in
//    reaver_tune().
//  - is_boss / acc_is_boss / acc_is_mini_boss are set SYNCHRONOUSLY on the
//    spawn frame so the frame-N+1 callback::on_ai_spawned speed hook already
//    sees them (map 1's Shielded spawn-order race). Those three fields are what
//    exempt it from the zombie speed curve, SUPPRESSING FIRE, IMPACT ROUNDS
//    splash, Thor's Thunder and the powerup drop roll — all eight consumers
//    read the same triad, so setting them is the whole integration.
//  - ignore_round_spawn_failsafe: the pack threads the stock 30s below-world
//    culler on every fury. The tower goes UP so this is belt-and-braces, but the
//    base arena sits at z≈0 and the check is `< -1000` on ANY actor.
//  - The bamf ghost failsafe lives in the vendored archetype (acc_bamf_ghost_
//    failsafe) — an interrupted bamf can otherwise strand it invisible AND
//    unhittable forever. Do not strip the [acc] tags out of that file.
