// _tod_hellhounds.gsc — THE HELLHOUNDS: elite #3 of the breather-door unlock
// ladder, bought with the LAP 30 breather door (user 2026-08-23: "add
// hellhounds with lots of health").
//
// WHY THIS ENEMY: it is the last complete, unused AI on this machine.
// <TOOLS>\share\raw\behavior ships ELEVEN behaviour trees and every other one
// is already spoken for — mechz = Panzer, zod_robot_companion = Rogue
// Protector, zm_genesis_apothicon_fury = Reaver, the rest are plain zombies,
// and zm_avogadro is a brain with no body. zm_factory_zombie_dog has the full
// chain: .ai_bt / .ai_asm / .ai_am / .ai_ast, an archetype + spawner aitype,
// a character, and a stock driver script (_zm_ai_dogs.gsc) that is ALREADY
// running in this build via zm_usermap.
//
// THIS IS NOT A DOG ROUND, and must never become one. level.dog_rounds_allowed
// stays 0 (zm_tod2_cybercity.gsc) — that flag gates ONLY
// zm_usermap -> zm_ai_dogs::enable_dog_rounds(), which is never called here.
// The endless-round twist has no room for a special round; hounds arrive as a
// PACK alongside the horde, the same shape as the Protector and the Reaver.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FOUR TRAPS, every one verified in stock source. Do not "simplify" past them.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  1. level.dog_health IS UNDEFINED IN THIS MAP, AND IT IS THE REAL HP KNOB.
//     zm_ai_dogs::dog_spawner_init returns early when the map has no
//     zombie_dog_spawner entities (ours has none), so its `level.dog_health =
//     100` line never runs. Then dog_init reads `int( level.dog_health * mult )`
//     — an undefined in arithmetic THROWS, and it throws MID-dog_init, before
//     the death handler and the failsafe thread are attached. Half-built enemy,
//     no death event, no reward. Worse, dog_run_think CLAMPS health DOWN to
//     level.dog_health when the dog becomes visible, so even a successful
//     SetHealth is undone ~1.6s later. We therefore set level.dog_health to the
//     hp we want IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SpawnActor, which makes that clamp a no-op
//     by construction instead of a nerf.
//  2. scr_dog_health_walk_multiplier DEFAULTS TO 4.0 (stock, in _zm_ai_dogs).
//     dog_init multiplies by it, and the reveal clamp then erases it. Harmless
//     in play (the dog is ghosted and shielded through that window) but it makes
//     live HP unreadable during a test, so init() pins it to 1.0.
//  3. _tod_zombie_speed's "is_zombie() gates out dogs/specials" COMMENT IS
//     WRONG. dog_init sets self.is_zombie = true, so on_ai_spawned DOES pick a
//     hound up: it would double-dip the co-op health multiplier on top of
//     boss_hp's own coop_hp_mult, and ASMSetAnimationRate the dog's own
//     locomotion. The is_boss / acc_is_boss / acc_is_mini_boss triad plus
//     tod_boss_custom_speed exempt both, and they MUST be set on the SPAWN
//     FRAME — the callback fires one waittillframeend later.
//  4. NEVER CALL zm_ai_dogs::special_dog_spawn(). Its comment advertises
//     "spawn dogs independent of the round", but it discards the spawn point it
//     is handed, two of its three branches index level.dog_spawners[0] on an
//     array this map leaves empty (a silent no-op that spins at the 0.05s
//     floor), its default branch throws on the absent dog_location struct, and
//     it hard-caps at 9. Bare SpawnActor on the spawner_ aitype is the path —
//     the same one _tod_bosses uses for the Rogue Protector.
//
// CLIENT SIDE: nothing to add, deliberately. _zm_ai_dogs.csc already rides in
// via zm_usermap.csc and registers the "dog_fx" clientfield (the eyes + fire
// trail). Adding a #using on the server half only would BREAK the lockstep this
// already has — so we add neither. ZERO new clientfield bits.

// COMBINED ELITE ROOF. The existing per-type roofs already permit 8 Protectors
// + 1 Panzer + 3 Reavers = 12 live elites, and the v10.4 audit established that
// ~12 starves stock's own 31-actor spawn gate and chokes the horde. A fourth
// type with a roof of 4 would make 16 reachable OUTSIDE the finale, where
// nothing trims zombie_ai_limit. Hounds therefore only ever fill SPARE capacity:
// they may not spawn while 9+ elites already stand. Legal one-directionally —
// this module imports _tod_bosses, never the reverse (the cycle the KB forbids).
// v13.22 (co-op elite scale-up): both roofs are per-player now — the defines
// stay as the SOLO bases. hound_max_alive() = 4+np/2 (4/5/5/6, the quad pack
// of 5 no longer clamps); hound_elite_roof() = 8+np (9/10/11/12). WHY THE
// ELITE ROOF HAD TO MOVE WITH THE OTHERS: elites_alive() counts
// protectors+panzer+reavers+hounds (sprinters deliberately absent — horde
// CONVERSIONS, zero extra actors), and the v13.22 quad worst case is
// 8+1+3 = 12 non-hound elites, which would sit permanently above a flat 9
// and STARVE hounds out of every quad confluence round. 12 is the historical
// reachable line the v10.4 audit measured (the pre-tankiness roofs permitted
// exactly 12); at quad it is brief, elite-kill throughput is four guns, and
// the horde-choke cost is one the map already carried at that line.
// (TOD_HOUND_ELITE_ROOF 9 RETIRED v18.9 — hound_elite_roof() returns the shared
// tod_bosses::elite_roof_all() now, so this had no readers left. The rationale
// block above is kept as the record of why hounds once had a private roof; it
// describes a retired flat-12 world and must not be read as current.)

// --- HP: the same anchored curve every other elite uses, so coop_hp_mult()
// rides in automatically inside boss_hp.
//
// WHY NOT THE LITERAL "5x" THE USER ASKED FOR: a stock hellhound's health is a
// flat stepped table that CAPS AT 1600 and never grows — a dog at round 5 and a
// dog at round 60 both have 1600. So 5x is 8,000 flat, and on this map's
// compounding horde that is 0.91x a TRASH ZOMBIE at round 30 and 0.35x at round
// 40. The literal number would ship an "elite" softer than the horde it spawns
// with, and the LAP 30 door would feel like it unlocked less than LAP 20 did.
// 16,000 on the standard curve kept the user's actual intent — a real threat —
// and landed the hound as the LIGHTEST elite, which is correct for the only one
// that arrives four at a time and outruns a sprinting player.
//
// -30% (user 2026-08-27: "nerf the dogs hellhounds health by 30%"), 16000 ->
// 11200. The curve multiplies off BASE from the anchor, so scaling the base is
// exactly -30% at EVERY round, not just at 30. Post-nerf reads:
//   solo r30  hound 11,200  vs  Reaver 43,178 / Protector 43,497 / Panzer 129,346
//   solo r30  trash zombie 8,788  ->  the hound is ~1.27x a zombie
// Still the lightest elite by far; its threat is the pack + the speed, not the
// pool. THE DIAL: this define alone, -GscOnly.

// hound is revealed — stock's own `dog_spawn_fx` waits 1.5; 1.2 keeps the tell
// without making a pack feel late.
#define TOD_HOUND_SPAWN_FX_SECS  1.2

// RETIRED v17.83: TOD_HOUND_SPAWN_HOLD_MS (2500). v17.43 withheld the hound's
// TARGET for 2.5 s to stop 306 throws of `pair '100' and 'undefined'` out of
// behavior_zombie_dog's GetYaw. That worked, and it cost the thing the enemy is
// for: a pack that stands still for three seconds after it lands. The correct
// guard was in stock all along and it is one field, not a timer —
// `ignoreme`. Read behavior_zombie_dog.gsc:378-400 in order:
//
//   :378  if ( ignoreall || pacifist || target invalid )  -> CLEARS favoriteenemy
//   :397  if ( IS_TRUE( ignoreme ) )                      -> plain `return`
//   :412  if ( isdefined( favoriteenemy ) && need_to_run() )   <- THE THROW SITE
//
// `ignoreme` returns from zombieDogTargetService BEFORE need_to_run() — the
// exact call that threw — and unlike `ignoreall` it does NOT wipe the target on
// its way past. So the hound can hold its enemy from the SpawnActor frame and
// still never run the yaw math while it is materialising. Stock reaches the
// same state by a different road (dog_init hides + shields, dog_spawn_fx clears
// ignoreme at the reveal); we do the half we can safely own.
//
// ⚠️ AND THAT SAME LINE :378 IS WHY A WORLD PAUSE COSTS EVERY DOG ITS TARGET:
// set_world_pause writes `ignoreall = true` on every axis AI, and the tree
// answers by clearing favoriteenemy. hound_target_watch re-picks within 0.5 s
// of the unpause, so it recovers — but nothing else in the map does, and that
// is worth knowing before adding another ignoreall writer.

// self = the hound. THE ARRIVAL (v17.83) — stock's dog_spawn_fx, rebuilt for a
// map that cannot call it.
//
// WHY NOT JUST CALL dog_spawn_fx: it asserts a magic bullet shield, calls
// util::stop_magic_bullet_shield on an actor that never got one, and runs
// zombie_setup_attack_properties_dog — all of it the tail of dog_init, which
// this map deliberately never runs (Ghosted + shielded + ignoreme, with only
// dog_spawn_fx's own tail to undo it, plus a second death handler fighting
// hound_death_watch). This is the half that is ours to own: the tell, the
// bolt, the shake, and the reveal.
//
// ONE-SHOT FX RIDE A tag_origin HOST. A bare server-side PlayFX draws for
// LOOPING effects only; one-shot bursts need a script_model host and
// PlayFxOnTag (this map's derez_burst_run / zap_burst_run are the proven
// lane). Stock gets away with `Playfx` here because its call sits in a
// different lane entirely — do not copy that line.
//
// NO `level endon( "end_game" )`: the only thing this thread owes the world is
// the Show() and the ignoreme clear, and a hound left hidden and untargetable
// forever is a worse outcome than a stray reveal at the end of a match. The
// `self endon( "death" )` is the one that matters — a hound killed mid-buildup
// is dead either way.
//
// The three `zmb_hellhound_*` aliases are stock's own (the game ships a
// `hellhound` sound loadspec). They are NOT in the mod tools' raw alias CSVs,
// so this is unverified from disk: if a bolt lands in silence, the aliases are
// the first thing to look at, not the fx.

// and calls SetGoal(self.origin), "stay at the spot". Nothing reassigns it, so
// that hound stands still FOR THE REST OF THE MATCH, even after a revive. In
// solo one down freezes the pack. Worse, frozen hounds are alive, so
// hounds_alive() keeps counting them and once hound_max_alive() are stuck the
// director never spawns another hound again.

	// and both fx are client-precached in stock and ship in zm_levelcommon.
	//
	// WHY OUR HOUNDS RENDER PLAIN: the ONLY place stock sets this field is

	// death handler fighting hound_death_watch().
