// =============================================================================
// _tod_finale.gsc — THE ENDING (v9, user 2026-08-21: "design the top of the
// map and design the ending ... a path way to a sick looking crown house ...
// boss fight we wouldn't implement, maybe a buyable ending for now").
//
// WHERE: the CROWN — the floating citadel at the top of the tower (geometry in
// tools/gen_tower_map.js §5; every anchor point this file uses comes from the
// GENERATED _tod_crown_data.gsc, so the script can never drift from the .map).
//
// v10 — THE LAST MILE (user 2026-08-23: "the music starts and game ends when
// songs ends and you win ... players get to the top and players have around
// 3:40 minutes to get to the building so that road needs to be long and they
// get ambushed in all directions max aggressivness on spawns and all types of
// enemies").
//
// THE SEQUENCE (all diegetic — no on-screen text until the stock end screen,
// the map's standing rule):
//   1. THE UPLINK — the terminal on the TERRACE, where the crown stair puts you
//      down. Needs power, costs TOD_FINALE_COST, hold USE to buy. It sits at
//      the START of the road now, not the far end of it, because the thing it
//      starts is the run.
//   2. THE RUN — the closing song takes the music channel and IS the clock
//      (TOD_FINALE_SONG_SECS, measured off the wav). The causeway walks ~8220 units
//      (v12; the generator prints the live number on every regen) of open
//      road; _tod_bosses::finale_pressure_start drives the spawn rate to
//      its floor and cycles all three boss types, and the road's own risers
//      (gen_tower_map.js) put them on alternating flanks the whole way. Upgrade
//      events are suppressed so the clock cannot drift from the track.
//      THE CROWN ITSELF lights up one corner point per quarter — a progress
//      read visible from the road, from inside the hall and from the tower,
//      but the song is the real countdown. (v11: these used to be four coil
//      props on plinths in the middle of the hall. The user called them weird
//      and they were; the read moved out onto the circlet.)
//      >>> FUTURE BOSS FIGHT goes HERE: a module that sets
//      level.tod_finale_boss_fn owns the run and the win lands when it returns.
//   3. THE SONG ENDS — you survived it, so you won. The four crown beacons
//      flip green, the
//      EXTRACTION PAD swaps red->green, then TOD_FINALE_DEPART_SECS of
//      invulnerable departure (pylons strobe, strike bursts) and the game ends
//      on a custom "YOU ESCAPED THE TOWER" screen (stock still prints rounds).
//      There is no pad to hold and no gather-everyone check any more — see the
//      note above exfil_beacon for why that had to be DELETED rather than left.
//
// MECHANISMS REUSED (nothing new to trust): script-spawned trigger_radius_use
// with TriggerIgnoreTeam (doors/stations), the todPerkGlow clientfield aura
// (_tod_perk_lights::set_glow — server PlayFX never renders, the client
// aura does), the scatter's host-based strike burst + sound emitter, the
// atmosphere's stoppable music primitive, and stock _zm's
// level.custom_game_over_hud_elem callback (verified tmp/bo3_stock_ref
// _zm.gsc:6064). Hint strings only change on STATE change (config-string
// discipline: every distinct hint costs one).

// not after it. Setting this to the full 197 was the first cut and it was
// WRONG: the alias is LOOPING (it has to be — a non-looping streamed one-shot

// with 12,000 points could have bought the run 30 seconds into the match.
// With this at 1, init() spawns the crown's props (sconces, pylons, the mast
// beacon, the uplink console as terrace scenery), opens the lane seals AND
// the terrace gate (the road is the way DOWN now — level.tod_gate_open true
// from init, which the endless-rounds riser filter reads), and returns before
// the crown door, the uplink trigger and the extraction beacon. The crown
// door's brush is _tod_doors' Fall gate under DESCENT (gen_tower_map.js).
// Nothing below is deleted: TOD II's ending is undesigned, and this flow is

			//      below, so the loop returns at "extract" and never reaches

			//
			// It stays paired because the noun tracks the TITLE, and the title
			// is the half that survives a reword of the detail. Drop the detail
			// line's "extraction" and "defend the crown" becomes the claimant
			// for real. What the table buys either way is CLAIM ORDER: nouns
