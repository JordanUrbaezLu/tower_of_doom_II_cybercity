// _tod_distraction.gsc — DISTRACTION, the ASSAULT's thrown-decoy upgrade
//
// v16.49 (user 2026-09-02): "change the distraction upgrade so now it only is
// cymbal monkeys and also what it does is increases the max number of cymbal
// monkeys you can hold. tier 1 is 1, tier 2 is 2, etc. And this goes up to 3.
// And we need to make sure a max ammo gives only 1 no matter what tier."
//
// HOW IT PLAYS
//   ONE WEAPON, THE CYMBAL MONKEY, and the LEVEL IS THE CARRY CAP: Lv1 holds 1,
//   Lv2 holds 2, Lv3 holds 3 (domain max 3). The first level hands you one
//   monkey; every level after that opens one more slot AND fills it (a card
//   that says "carry one more" and hands you nothing would read as a dud).
//   MAX AMMO adds exactly ONE, at every level, capped at the level — never a
//   refill, which takes an explicit opt-out from stock's powerup; see
//   on_max_ammo(). The v14.59-v16.48 form (Lv1 monkey, Lv2 Li'l Arnies, flat
//   cap 3) is GONE: the octobomb is no longer registered, granted or opted out
//   here, and nothing else in the map hands it out.
//
// WHY A MODULE, AND WHY LEVEL-DRIVEN RATHER THAN A CARD HOOK
//   A grenade is INVENTORY, and inventory does not survive a spawn. Stock's
//   init_player_offhand_weapons nulls the tactical slot pointer on EVERY
//   "spawned_player"; usermaps never set level.zombie_tactical_grenade_player_init,
//   so the slot is weaponNone every life. _tod_classes::give_class_loadout
//   re-gives only the primary, the alt melee and the sidearm — it never looks at
//   a domain.
//   Worse, THREE paths write a domain level without ever calling apply_upgrade:
//   tier_up's reset loop, tier_up's grant field, and the dev grant-all
//   (dev_grant_maxed). A one-shot "on card pick" hook is skipped by all three,
//   and a granted player would end up with a maxed domain and no grenade.
//   So the effect is a RECONCILE — read the level, make the inventory match.
//   It is idempotent and every one of those paths lands by construction.
//
// THREE ENGINE TRAPS, ALL PAID FOR ON MAP 1 (docs/09, _acc_boss_items.gsc)
//   1. Raw GiveWeapon does NOT ARM the grenade. The thrown behaviour is threaded
//      by the registered zombie-weapon callback, and zm_weapons::weapon_give is
//      the only stock path that dispatches it. We dispatch it by hand. Without
//      this the projectile lands and just sits there — no error, no tell.
//   2. get_player_tactical_grenade() returns level.weaponNone, NEVER undefined.
//      An isdefined() guard alone is a no-op that TakeWeapon(weaponNone)s.
//      Test `!= level.weaponNone` as well, always.
//   3. Re-assert set_player_tactical_grenade EVERY time. HasWeapon can be TRUE
//      while the slot pointer is dead — a state where the player holds the
//      grenade and the throw does nothing. Never skip the re-assert on an
//      `if ( HasWeapon ) return;` fast path.
//   (The fourth trap — register_tactical_grenade_for_level for the octobomb —
//   retired with the octobomb. Stock zm_usermap.gsc:173 already registers the
//   cymbal_monkey, so this module registers nothing.)
//
// COSTS NOTHING TO INCLUDE. The monkey is already included via
// gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv (row `cymbal_monkey`), and
// stock zm_usermap already #using's _zm_weap_cymbal_monkey on BOTH VMs — so
// this feature adds ZERO clientfields, ZERO zone weapon lines and ZERO weapon
// registrations against the ~230 twin ceiling.
//   *** DO NOT add a `weapon,cymbal_monkey_zm` .zone line. *** No GDT on this
//   box defines the asset, so the link hard-fails with "Unable to load weapon".
//   The CSV row IS the inclusion lane. Do not "tidy" that row or _zm-suffix it
//   either (memory: weapons-csv-zm-suffix-mismatch).
//
// Domain id 41 in _tod_upgrade_ui::domain_id + tod_upgrade.lua DOMAIN/DETAIL
// (ids are APPEND-ONLY; 40 is PERK SLOTS). This module imports _tod_upgrades for
// get_level — _tod_upgrades never imports us (the KB cycle rule). Same for
// _tod_powerups, which reaches us through level.tod_distract_max_ammo.

// TWO HALVES, AND ONLY THE PAIR WORKS:

//       full_ammo_powerup skips it entirely. Without (a) this function still
//       runs and still "succeeds" — it just adds +1 to a count stock has already
//       maxed, so the clamp eats it and nothing changes. AN INCREMENT ON TOP OF
//       A REFILL IS INVISIBLE, not broken; do not read a working on_max_ammo()
//       as proof the ladder is live.
//   (b) this function, called from _tod_powerups::max_ammo_clip_watch through
//       level.tod_distract_max_ammo after its 0.05s "let stock finish" wait.
//
// WHY IT RIDES THE EXISTING WATCHER rather than adding a second "zmb_max_ammo"
// waittill: one notify with two independent listeners is two race-prone orderings
// against the same 0.05s settle. The clip watcher already owns that wait, already
// has the respawn latch, and already runs at exactly the right moment.
//
// LEVEL-GATED, NOT INVENTORY-GATED. A player who does not own the domain gets
// nothing — we never hand out a grenade from a powerup, only top up one the
// upgrade already granted. HasWeapon is checked too: mid-life the slot can be
