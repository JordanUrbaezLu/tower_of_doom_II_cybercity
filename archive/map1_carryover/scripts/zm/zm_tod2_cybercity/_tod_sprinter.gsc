// =============================================================================
// _tod_sprinter.gsc — THE ARMORED SPRINTER: elite #3 of the breather-door
// unlock ladder (user 2026-08-29), NEW enemy — NOT a Reaver replacement (user:
// "i actually wanted to add an anemey rather than replace"). The ladder now:
//   floor 10 Protector / 20 Reaver / 30 ARMORED SPRINTER / 40 hellhounds
// (the sprinter takes the lap-30 slot the hounds held; the hounds move into
// the lap-40 slot that had been reserved-empty since the ladder was built).
//
// ⚠️ THE NAME IS HISTORICAL. Since v14.44 this thing is SLOWER than a plain
// zombie of the same round, not faster (TOD_SPRINT_SPEED_ADD is -10; it was
// +15 when the name was chosen). It is a lumbering armored tank now, and that
// is the intent — the armor and the 10x health are the threat. Nothing
// player-facing carries the word (no hint string, no banner, no LUI text —
// checked), so the name was left alone rather than churning every reference.
// If it reads as a bug to you, it is not: read TOD_SPRINT_SPEED_ADD.
//
// THE SPEC (user, verbatim intent — originally phrased as a Reaver rework,
// re-scoped to a new enemy the same hour):
//   * "a lot of smoke coming from him"      -> two steam-jet FX, spine + head
//   * "run at +15 round speed"              -> tod_zspeed_round_add. THE SIGN
//     HAS SINCE FLIPPED: +15 -> +12 -> +10 -> -10 (user 2026-08-31), so they
//     now run SLOWER than the round, not faster. Read TOD_SPRINT_SPEED_ADD,
//     never this line. (_tod_zombie_speed::apply_speed_for_round reads it)
//   * "come every 3 rounds"                 -> TOD_SPRINT_INTERVAL 3
//   * health: launched as "regular health of a regular zombie" (conversion
//     gives that for free); RETUNED 2026-08-29 after the flood test to
//     TOD_SPRINT_HP_MULT 20 ("Give them 20x health for now") — a SHIP tune,
//     not a dev knob — then HALVED to 10 (v16.60, user 2026-09-02: "nerf the
//     armored sprinters health"). x10 stacks with the 1/3 armor: ~x30
//     effective against EVERY damage source since v14.20 (it was x20 vs
//     melee/explosives while the armor was bullets-only — see
//     TOD_SPRINT_DMG_FRAC). Read the define, never this line.
//   * "bullets do 1/4 damage"               -> level.tod_sprinter_dmg_frac,
//     applied inside _tod_upgrades::upgrade_damage_cb — NOT a second
//     registered callback, because stock's dispatch (_zm.gsc:5822) is
//     FIRST-NON-(-1)-WINS, not a chain: upgrade_damage_cb returns a final for
//     every player hit, so a callback registered after it never runs. Field
//     lane, no import (the cycle rule).
//   * "armored zombie skin ... map 1"       -> SetModel c_t8_zmb_mob_zombie_
//     body3 (the BOTD chain-armor body, map 1 _acc_elites promote_to_shielded)
//     + no_gib so the armor never comes off (map 1's user rule).
//   * "bullets bouncing off"                -> zmb_rocketshield_imp at the
//     victim, 200ms debounce — the same stock alias map 1's Shielded deflect
//     used (_acc_damage.gsc "Shielded deflect").
//
// WHAT CONVERSION BUYS OVER SPAWNING (and what it costs):
//   + native pathing (they ARE horde zombies — no archetype, no behaviour
//     tree, none of the "attacks but never walks" class of failure)
//   + regular health with zero code, exactly as asked
//   + they count toward the round total (a sprinter kill advances the round)
//   - no boss triad, so: no gauge pip (the SMOKE is the tell), GIANT SLAYER
//     does not apply (they are horde-strength, not elites), and nuke /
//     insta-kill treat them as the zombies they are. All accepted.
//   - NO finale role, deliberately: nothing raises sprinter debt during THE
//     LAST MILE and they never occupy a FINALE_BOSS_ROOF slot — the road's
//     pressure stays Panzer/Protector/Reaver/hound, all real elites.
//
// CONVERSION IS A 1s DIRECTOR SWEEP, NOT A SPAWN CALLBACK (v13.9 — the flood
// test caught the callback version converting NOTHING: on_ai_spawned fires
// before zombie_spawn_init sets is_zombie/model/health, so every guard
// rejected every actor and every write would have been clobbered anyway; the
// full record is at init()). The sweep sees only settled actors. The dev
// round-1 flood harness that proved all of this is REMOVED (recipe below the
// defines) — ship state can only raise debt via the lap-30 stamp in
// round_watch, by construction.
//
// Reference-three welder gear is exclusive to armored sprinters. Promotion
// replaces a recognized intact head with the SAME stock head wearing its new
// kit; the cosmetic helper removes the old helmet and respects native gibs.
