// =============================================================================
// _tod_mage_elements.gsc — THE MAGE's three staffs, their matchups, and the
// HEALING AURA on the lethal button. docs/114 §C (v18.30 revamp).
//
// THE DESIGN (user 2026-09-07, "completely revamp the mage"):
//   * THREE STAFFS, held at once, switched like any weapon, EACH ONE ITS OWN
//     ELEMENT: LIGHTNING (tier 1) -> + FIRE (tier 2) -> + ICE (tier 3). A tier
//     promotion ADDS a staff and takes nothing away. No sidearm. No combat
//     stance, no face-button spells -- the trigger IS the spell.
//   * EACH STAFF IS GOOD AT ITS OWN THING: lightning answers the horde, fire
//     answers the robots and the armored, ice answers the hounds and the Fury.
//     Every staff is WEAK against the Panzer.
//   * UPGRADES ARE PER STAFF: CHAIN LIGHTNING (53) on the lightning staff,
//     FIRE BLAST (49, tier 2+) on the fire staff, ICE SHATTER (50, tier 3+) on
//     the ice staff, ATTUNEMENT (51) on the aura's recharge, HEALING AURA (52)
//     on the aura itself. All scope "class": a promotion never resets them.
//   * HEALING AURA must be unlocked by its first card, then casts with LETHAL.
//     BLINK uses TACTICAL; ARCHMAGE uses AIM. Staffs have no aim-down-sights.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS vs WHAT IT ARMS. The staffs are ordinary weapons: the
// engine fires the bolt, stock delivers the hit, and _tod_upgrades'
// upgrade_damage_cb is the ONE damage chain on this map (FIRST-NON-(-1)-WINS,
// so a second callback would never run). That module cannot #using this one
// (it is imported here -- the KB cycle rule), so the interface is TWO GUARDED
// LEVEL POINTERS set in init() and read by the callback:
//   level.tod_mage_staff_mult( attacker, victim, weapon ) -> the multiplier
//     (tier ladder x matchup x the staff's own upgrade card)
//   level.tod_mage_staff_hit( attacker, victim, weapon, dmg ) -> the on-hit
//     effect (burn tell / slow / chain lightning)
//   level.tod_mage_pierce_armor( weapon ) -> true for the FIRE staff, so the
//     callback skips the armored sprinter's damage cut for it
// Both pointers are undefined while TOD_MAGE_ENABLED is 0, and the callback's
// arms are `isdefined` guarded, so a shipped build with the class off runs
// none of it.
//
// CHAIN LIGHTNING re-enters the callback through the tod_mage_chain_hit mark
// (the CLEAVE idiom): the extra hits are DoDamage'd with the mark set, the
// callback consumes it and passes the figure through untouched (the victim's
// sprinter armor still applies -- the cleave rule).

// THE TIER LADDER, script-side. gen_tod_twins.js emits the three staffs FLAT
// (`flat: true` on the fire and ice rungs -- no TIER_DPS normalization),
// because the tiers here are held TOGETHER, not one after another: a tier-3
// mage's lightning staff must be as strong as their ice staff. So the class
// tier scales EVERY staff, and it uses the SAME 1 / 1.5625 / 2.4414 ladder the
// other four classes climb through their generated tiers (TIER_DPS in the
// generator -- LOCKSTEP PAIR).
// =============================================================================
// THE CLASS TIER LADDER -- AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE GUN LADDER (v18.51).
//
// ⚠️ THIS USED TO BE A LOCKSTEP PAIR WITH TIER_DPS IN gen_tod_twins.js
// (1 / 1.5625 / 2.4414) AND IT IS NOT ONE ANY MORE. Do not "fix" the drift:
// the divergence IS the design. A future reader who restores the gun numbers
// here deletes the whole class curve and will see nothing fail.
//
// User 2026-09-08: "I want the mage to be medium ranked at early mid game,
// late game High ranked and Very late game OP." Ranked among the five classes
// on sustained horde output, packed, no cards -- the shipped v18.50 ladder had
// the curve upside down:
//
//              was (1 / 1.5625 / 2.4414)        now (0.92 / 2.00 / 3.95)
//   tier 1     rank 2 of 5   HIGH               rank 3 of 5   MEDIUM
//   tier 2     rank 3 of 5   MEDIUM             rank 3 of 5   MEDIUM
//   tier 3     rank 4 of 5   LOW                rank 2 of 5   HIGH
//
// The guns step x1.5625 per rung, evenly. The mage steps x2.17 then x1.98 off
// a base cut 8%, so its promotions are the two biggest single power steps in
// the map and its floor-30 tier card is the most valuable card any class can
// be dealt. That is what "back-loaded" has to mean when the only thing a class
// can spend a tier on is the same three weapons it already holds.
//
// VERY LATE is NOT on this ladder -- there is no tier 4. It is carried by three
// mage-only multipliers that all grow with how deep the run is: ARCHMAGE uptime
// (fed by kills, see TOD_MAGE_ARCH_MANA_KILL_LV), the per-staff card ladders
// (+60% each at cap), and CHAIN LIGHTNING, whose arcs land more often the denser the
// horde. No gun class has an analogue for any of the three.
// =============================================================================

// will be good against robots and the armor, and then the ice will be good
// against the hounds, the dogs, and the furies. And overall, the mage will be
// pretty weak against the Panzers.")
// v18.44 REBUILT THIS AS ONE FAMILY TABLE (user: "I want this class to be more
// skilled so each staff is good against what they are good against and bad
// against the rest"). Before this the off-matchup case was NEUTRAL — fire and ice
// did full damage to the horde — so there was never a reason to swap BACK, and a
// tier-3 mage could hold one staff all match. Now every victim belongs to exactly
// one family and the staff either owns it or is punished for it.
//

//   lightning       x1.25       x0.45          x0.45      x0.40

//   ice             x0.45       x0.45          x2.00      x0.40
//
// THE PANZER TAX REPLACES THE OFF-FAMILY PENALTY, it does not stack with it.
// He is nobody's target, so stacking would have taken every staff to x0.16.
// "Weak against Panzers" was never meant to read as "cannot participate".
//
// LIGHTNING'S OWN FAMILY PAYS LESS THAN THE OTHER TWO, and that is deliberate:
// it fires roughly seven times for every fire-staff shot and CHAIN LIGHTNING
// arcs on top, so its reward is RATE. A x2.00 here would double the class's
// bread-and-butter damage rather than sharpen a choice.
// =============================================================================
// THE PANZER IS LIGHTNING'S TARGET (v18.52). IT USED TO BE NOBODY'S.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY PROSE DESCRIPTION OF THIS CLASS SAID "the worst Panzer answer in the
// map" AND THAT IS NOW THE OPPOSITE OF TRUE. User 2026-09-08: "Best weapon
// against panzers should be the lightning staff." The universal x0.40 was an
// implementation reading of "each staff is good against what they are good
// against and bad against the rest" -- it left the Panzer with no right answer
// at all, which is the same hole family_answerable() was written to close one
// version ago: a matchup table that punishes every choice is not a choice.
//
// So the table is symmetric at last. Three families, three staffs, one owner
// each, and the Panzer sits in lightning's:
//     horde + PANZER          -> lightning
//     protector + sprinter    -> fire
//     hellhound + Fury        -> ice
//
// WHY THE BONUS IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN x2.00. Two reasons, and both are
// arithmetic rather than taste:
//   (1) A STAFF CANNOT CRIT. Every gun figure it is measured against assumes
//       head hits and therefore carries the engine's flat x3.0 hit-location
//       crit; a staff hit is splash and takes none. A third of the multiplier
//       below is buying that back, not buying power.
//   (2) Lightning's own family pays x1.25, not x2.00, because its reward is
//       RATE -- so it starts from the lowest matchup number in the table.
// Historical PRE-ARMOR estimate: x5.60 gives about 76,245 -- RANK 3,
// a hair under the Death Machine's 77,625 and above the MP7. That placement is
// the user's own ("you can place him right under death machine DPS"), and
// v18.53 made it the rule for all four families rather than a one-off.
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN THE MAP. The first pass at this
// put it at 108,900, above every primary; the user pulled it back. What makes
// the class strong against a Panzer is not the figure, it is that the figure
// EXISTS -- every other class has an enemy it has no answer to, and the mage
// has none. With ARCHMAGE running it reaches ~244,000 and is first outright,
// which is the payoff for spending the bar on the fight it was saved for.
// =============================================================================
#define TOD_MAGE_LIGHTNING_VS_PANZER 4.76   // v18.53: a DIRECT multiplier now; 5.60 -> 4.76 (v18.77, user 2026-09-10: "Lightning needs 15% nerf against panzers")
// TOD_MAGE_OFF_PANZER (0.40) RETIRED v18.56 -- the Panzer arm reads each staff's
// own off_family_mult() now, which is how ice became okay against him.
// =============================================================================
// ONE MULTIPLIER PER FAMILY, AND THEY ARE ALL CALIBRATED TO ONE RULE (v18.53).
//
// User 2026-09-08, on what the class IS: "what makes him OP is that his best
// staff is always top 3 against the weakness enemy" -- and, for the Panzer,
// "you can place him right under death machine DPS".
//
// THE CONTRACT IS TWO STATES, NOT ONE (corrected v18.54, user: "his maxed out
// fire blast should be 1 against their weakness. Easily"). The first pass folded
// the maxed card INTO the rank-3 target, which left a fully-invested mage still
// third -- so the six cards you spend on a staff bought nothing but parity.
//
//   UNINVESTED (the staff's own card at 0)  -> RANK 3, just under the Death
//                                              Machine. The user's placement.
//   FULLY INVESTED (that card maxed)        -> RANK 1, and not narrowly.
//
// So the class is never worse than third to ANYTHING, and it is first against
// whatever it has actually paid to specialise in. Breadth by default, peak by
// investment. Every other class has a target it is helpless against; this one
// has none, and has one it is best at. Tier-3, packed, DAMAGE 10:
//
// THE WHOLE MATRIX, maxed cards (rN = rank among the five classes' primaries):
//
//                lightning        fire            ice        best gun
//   horde      70,799 r3*     28,146 r5      61,904 r4       DM 77,625
//   armour      6,127 r5     122,418 r1*     61,904 r4       AK 84,749
//   beast       6,127 r5      28,146 r5      87,925 r1*      AK 84,749
//   panzer     76,245 r3*     28,146 r5      61,904 r4       AK 84,749
//                                                  (* = owns that family)
//
// Read the COLUMNS, not the rows -- they are what the class is. Lightning covers
// two families and is nothing outside them. Fire is a 4.3x spike. Ice is flat:
// never rank 1 except at home, never below rank 4 anywhere, INCLUDING the
// Panzer. So there is always a right answer, and usually a safe one too.
//
// The UNINVESTED half of the contract still holds on the diagonal: with its own
// card at 0 each staff sits at rank 3, just under the Death Machine.
//
// (rank 1 needs to clear the AK's 84,749 on elites, the Death Machine's 77,625
// on trash.) LIGHTNING HAS NO DAMAGE CARD OF ITS OWN, so its growth lever is
// ARCHMAGE rather than a staff card -- which is why the two lightning rows climb
// further, and why the Panzer figure the user pinned "right under death machine"
// is the UNINVESTED one and is not raised here.
//
// THE FOUR NUMBERS DIFFER BECAUSE THE STAFFS DO, and a shared ON_FAMILY could
// not express that -- it was 2.00 for both fire and ice, which landed them at
// rank 4 and rank 4 while the same constant put lightning at rank 5 on the
// horde. Ice needs the most because its raw DPS is the lowest of the three;
// lightning needs the most of all against a Panzer because it has no damage
// card of its own and no crit. Retune by RANK, never by copying one of these
// onto another: tools/... the checker lives in the armory's Mage tab.
//
// WHY THE NUMBERS LOOK BIG NEXT TO A GUN'S. Every figure above gives the guns
// the engine's flat x3.0 HEAD CRIT, because that is how the Verdict tab prices
// them and it is what perfect play does. A staff hit is SPLASH and takes no
// hit-location multiplier at all, so roughly a third of each constant below is
// buying back a crit the weapon can never land, not buying power.
//
// LIGHTNING'S HORDE NUMBER WAS TUNED with six arcs at half the hit (x4.0).
// The 2026-09-09 nerf caps Lv6 at four arcs; Dark makes it five (six until the ceiling pass).
// Keep the direct-hit multiplier unchanged. The original comparison counts
// OVERDRIVE and the skirmisher's counts RUN AND GUN: it is that class's maxed
// card for that exact situation. Against a lone trash zombie lightning is far
// weaker than this row, and that is correct -- it is the HORDE staff.

// above, which is the shotgun identity and fair for standing in the pile). Ice

// as the trigger could be clicked ("we made the rate of fire super super
// fast"). The cadence is the ENGINE's again — one owner, no race, and exactly
// the engine's own gate, one number, no race.
