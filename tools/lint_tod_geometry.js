// tools/lint_tod_geometry.js — the HOLES AND MISPLACED WALLS gate.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// user 2026-08-23, on expanding the finale road: "Keep adding geometry, one
// thing to be carefull of are holes and miss placed walls."
//
// Both failures are silent. A hole is a gap in a rail over 19,000 units of open
// sky — nothing reports it, the map builds, bakes and boots, and the first
// anyone hears is a player falling. A misplaced wall is worse, because it is
// invisible: this map shipped one for weeks (the lap-1 "rail cap E" starting at
// knee height ON the arena floor instead of on top of the rail) and it was
// reported three separate times as "there's an invisible barrier somewhere" and
// hunted by eye before it was found.
//
// gen_tower_map.js's road builder already refuses to emit a road with either
// defect — it declares deck as grid cells and DERIVES the rails, so a hole
// would have to be a hole in the cell list. But a builder that checks itself
// proves nothing about a bug in the builder. This tool parses the FINISHED .map
// from scratch, knows nothing about the cell list, and re-proves the same
// properties from the brushes that actually shipped.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES
//
//   1. NO MISPLACED WALL   no INVISIBLE blocker intrudes into the volume a
//                          player stands in, anywhere a player can stand.
//   2. NO UNGUARDED EDGE   every standing surface whose neighbour is not floor
//                          has something chest-high beside it.
//   3. REACHABILITY        two named routes stay walkable: base arena -> terrace
//                          (the climb every player makes) and terrace -> citadel
//                          (the finale road). Plus a detachment count, gated on
//                          increase, for everything else.
//                          docs/163: when the .map carries tod_jumppad_* structs
//                          the road is CUT and the second route is instead
//                          citadel -> terrace THROUGH the pad (a one-way edge,
//                          launch -> landing) — the Fall's only way out.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE — and this matters more than what it can:
//
//   * SCRIPT-SPAWNED COLLISION. A .map parse is static. The 52 door slabs, the
//     causeway gate while shut, the perk machines after they scatter, and every
//     runtime DisconnectPaths() are invisible to it. Blockers are taken from
//     WORLDSPAWN ONLY, so door slabs (which are entities) drop out and what gets
//     proved is the ALL-DOORS-BOUGHT world — which is the state worth proving,
//     but it is not the only state the game has.
//   * ANYTHING A PREFAB BRINGS. Prefab collision is not in this file.
//   * WHETHER THE NAVMESH AGREES. Zombies path on the navmesh, not on this.
//   * A GAP NARROWER THAN THE SAMPLING GRID, in geometry not aligned to it.
//     Columns snap DOWN, so coverage is over-reported by up to G-1 units — the
//     one direction that can HIDE a hole rather than invent one. The CAUSEWAY is
//     exact (the road builder asserts every coordinate is a multiple of ROAD_G,
//     which is this G); the TOWER is not, and is the half this tool is weakest
//     on. Every run prints which is which, so the limit and the pass are read in
//     the same breath. Details in the note above the snap helper in run().
//
// IF THIS TOOL GOES RED ON A MAP SOMEBODY HAS WALKED, SUSPECT THIS TOOL.
// Twice on the day it was written, a new check failed on known-good geometry
// and both times the check was wrong, not the map (see the stacked-floor note
// in run() and the stepsTo comment). A human having completed the route is
// stronger evidence than a static sampler, and "fixing" the map to satisfy an
// unproven check would be the actual regression. Reach for
// lint_tod_geometry_selftest.js and a probe before reaching for the generator.
// The one thing never to do is edit the baseline to make it green.
//
//   So a PASS means "no static hole and no static invisible wall". It does not
//   mean "the map is fine", and it is not a substitute for walking it.
//
// Usage:  node tools/lint_tod_geometry.js            check against the baseline
//         node tools/lint_tod_geometry.js --update   accept current as baseline
//         node tools/lint_tod_geometry.js --crown    narrow to the finale road
//         node tools/lint_tod_geometry.js --verbose  every finding, with coordinates
//         node tools/lint_tod_geometry.js some.map   lint a candidate file instead
//         node tools/lint_tod_geometry_selftest.js   prove it still catches a hole

// MATERIAL TAXONOMY — the whole lint rests on this table.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Peer review (2026-08-23) got this right and it is worth restating: do NOT
// infer "floor" from shape. This map deliberately puts invisible clip on top of
// every rail so the tops are not standable (RAIL_CAP_H). A sampler that treats
// any horizontal surface as floor finds every rail top as floor, then finds the
// intentional cap above it, and reports the map's most carefully designed
// feature as the invisible-barrier bug.
//
// So: an explicit table, and an UNKNOWN MATERIAL IS A HARD FAILURE. A new
// material silently defaulting to "not a blocker" is how a lint quietly stops
// working six versions after the person who wrote it stopped looking.
//
// Every entry was derived by mapping each material back to the brush LABELS that
// use it in the generated .map, not by reading the generator's MAT table and
// guessing — several materials serve two purposes and only the labels say which.

//   `ammo crate body` — the four breather ammo crates (2026-08-24) plus the

//   acc_west_ammo_crate, which ships CollisionMap "" and BulletCollisionFile "",
//   so Solid() has nothing to switch on. A SOLID brush was tried first and was
//   worse in both directions: it showed through the mesh, and it swallowed the

// The four north-wall companion benches use their measured model footprints;

//   generator cuts a ring of wedges round it from the same JP_PAD / JP_PAD_YAW it emits for _tod_jumppad, open at the

// DECK BY LABEL (v17.32) — the one place this file classes a brush by what it IS
// rather than by what it is MADE OF, and the reason is worth stating because it
// is the hole this table always had.
//
// The class is keyed on the MATERIAL, and the header above already admits the
// weakness: "several materials serve two purposes and only the labels say
// which." Until v17.32 no material actually did, so material-as-key held. Then
// the arena floor took plain `blue` (user's call — the lighter grid line), and
// plain `blue` is ALSO every base wall, parapet, rail and under-stair fill in
// the map, which are BLOCK. One name, two genuinely different roles, and no
// choice of class is right for both: BLOCK deletes the arena floor from the
// walkability flood and reports the map unreachable; DECK gives every parapet in
// the map standing room and invents unguarded edges by the hundred.
//
// So these three labels — and they are the WHOLE ground-level floor, nothing
// else — are deck regardless of material. Same shape as MODEL_CLIP_COLUMNS
// above: an explicit, enumerated exception, not an inference from shape.
//
// The thickness gate still applies (`isDeck` below ANDs it), so this can only
// ever promote a genuine slab. 'ground slab' matches the spire's own base slab
// too, which is also a floor and already DECK by material — the override agrees
// with it rather than changing it.
//
// ⚠️ KEEP THIS LIST SHORT AND EXACT. Every entry is a place the material table
// stopped being the authority, and an over-broad pattern here would silently
// turn walls into floor — the failure this whole file exists to prevent. If it
// ever needs a fourth entry, ask first whether the material should have been
