"""Author the Rampage Inducer's two glow effects from an existing donor.

USER, 2026-09-13, on seeing the ported BO6 inducer in game: *"it's not really
glowing ... it needs to glow a dim orange of some sort. And then when it's on,
it needs to pulse a deeper orange. And that's the indicator that it's on. But
when it's off, it just has, like, a dim kinda lamp, orange light lamp."*

TWO EFFECTS, one donor:
  fx_tod_inducer_idle  OFF - a dim, STEADY orange lamp. Always on, from spawn.
  fx_tod_inducer_on    ON  - a deeper, hotter orange that PULSES.

DONOR: share/raw/fx/acc/light/fx_perk_glow_amber.efx, one of map 1's
self-authored perk-machine auras. It is the right donor for three reasons: it
already carries a real dynamic light (`light_small`, intensity 512 / radius 60),
that light is already `editorFlags looping` with `spawnLooping 200` over a
1,000 ms life so it re-spawns forever, and its `lightIntensityGraph` is already
a two-hump curve - so a pulse is a matter of RESHAPING a curve that exists, not
inventing one. Reuse over authoring (memory reuse-over-authoring).

v18.99j: ONLY `light_small` survives - the model glows through its own emissive
materials now (install_inducer_bo3.py) and this effect is just the light it throws
on the floor. The sprite notes below describe the v18.99i shape and are kept for
the record; `sprite_scale` / `alpha_flat` are inert while the sprite is dropped.

WHAT IS CHANGED, and nothing else:
- Only the `glow` sprite and the `light_small` dynamic light are kept. The
  donor's `exp` and `glow_spikes` elements are DROPPED: they are burst shapes
  that read as an explosion on a prop that is supposed to sit there like a lamp.
- Every colorGraph key is retinted to the target orange, keeping its time.
- lightIntensityGraph's base and curve are replaced outright - flat for idle,
  a single clean 0.30 -> 1.00 -> 0.30 hump per second for the ON pulse.
- alphaGraph is flattened for idle so the sprite does not shimmer.

SERVER-SIDE PLAYFX IS VALID HERE because both effects LOOP; a non-looping FX
played from the server renders nothing (memory ambient-fx-server-loop-lane).

Both need a `fx,tod/fx_tod_inducer_*` line in the .zone or they silently never
play. Run: python tools/gen_tod_inducer_fx.py
