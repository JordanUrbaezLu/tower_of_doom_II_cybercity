// tools/gen_tod_sky.js — THE CYBERCITY SKY (v17.71 → v17.87, 2026-09-05; v19.19 SMOOTH SOLIDS, 2026-09-16)
//
// Renders the map's own sky: a synthwave neon-grid metropolis on an
// EQUIRECTANGULAR lat-long panorama, the exact format every BO3 sky uses
// (materialType "sky_latlong_hdr", 8192x4096, one image on the stock T6 dome
// mesh — see docs/104_cybercity_sky.md for the proof chain).
//
// WHY PROCEDURAL AND NOT COMMISSIONED ART: a lat-long sky wraps at its left
// and right edge with clampU/clampV = 1, so the seam is whatever is baked in.
// Treyarch's shipped Miami sky matches column 0 to column 8191 within 0.06 of
// 65535; an image generator cannot promise that, and a mismatched seam draws a
// vertical line from horizon to zenith that a player on a spiral stair spins
// past every lap. Here EVERY value is a function of (azimuth, elevation) and
// the city is placed in world space and ray-cast per column, so the seam is
// exact BY CONSTRUCTION — az = (x + 0.5) / W * 2pi is periodic in W.
//
// THE PICTURE (display-referred, what the player should SEE):
//   SKY   a vertical gradient (theme), nebula with FILAMENTS and DUST LANES,
//         a milky-way band, a coloured star field with glints, THE MOON
//         (cratered, limb-darkened, haloed), planets with an atmosphere limb,
//         two black holes of DIFFERENT designs that LENS the stars behind them,
//         an aurora opposite the moon, three laser bars, and TWO CLOUD DECKS
//         on real planes above the eye (foreshortened toward the horizon, lit
//         from below by the city, silvered by the moon) that pass in front of
//         everything above.
//   CITY  ~2000 wireframe blocks on a street lattice out to 12k, then a FAR
//         RING of megastructures (13k..30k: mega-towers, arcologies, twin
//         towers with sky-bridges, megablocks) — all ray-cast per column with
//         real perspective; setback tiers, antennas of four kinds, glyph
//         billboards, holographic panels floating over the roofs, elevated
//         RING HIGHWAYS on pylons, searchlight beams, ground reflections,
//         street traffic and high air-lane traffic, three landmarks.
//   BELOW a Tron grid plane receding into the horizon haze.
//   then a bloom pass over everything emissive.
//
// DEPTH (v17.87, user: "everything is at the same layer ... ours looks
// cartoony and backgroundy rather than atmospheric"). A lat-long sky has no
// parallax, so depth has to be PAINTED: atmospheric perspective. Every drawn
// thing carries its distance d and two curves of it —
//   fog(d)      = exp(-d / HAZE_D)   surface CONTRAST: fills converge on the sky
//                                    colour behind them, neon edges pale toward
//                                    the haze, the face grid dissolves by ~8k
//   lightFog(d) = exp(-d / LIGHT_D)  point LIGHTS carry farther than surfaces:
//                                    hazed towers keep sparse twinkling windows
// plus a LIGHT-POLLUTION DOME at the horizon whose strength follows the real
// skyline density per bearing (GLOW_AZ, accumulated from the geometry), so far
// silhouettes stand against a lit smog band instead of a flat gradient. Two
// composition LANES (toward the moon, toward the low ringed giant) cap building
// heights so the bodies rise BEHIND the skyline rather than sitting on it.
// The body clearance against the skyline is printed on every run — read it.
//
// EXPOSURE — SKY_GAIN, AND THE SKY IS A LIGHT SOURCE (v17.74, docs/104 §4).
// The material displays the file through skyScaleRGB 1097.5 (pack-constant)
// AND bakes it into the world as ambient light through skyStops 10.0 (cloned
// from Miami, whose file is near-black). The pack keeps image mean × 2^skyStops
// ≈ 1.3; gain 0.06 scored ~4.0 and lit every wall olive-yellow while blowing
// the sky white. The STATS line printed at the end is that score — v17.82
// shipped at 0.478 with an R/G/B share of 22/27/51 AT FULL SIZE (a 2048
// preview reads ~1.7x higher: line weight does not scale with W, so compare
// like with like), and a picture change must hold it (move SKY_GAIN, not the
// picture) or the world's lighting moves too.
//
// QUALITY (v18.87, 2026-09-13 — learned from Tower II's hellscape sky v0.5-v0.7, docs/104 §4g):
//   * the sky is PAINTED at 2x the shipped size (--ss 2: 16384x8192) and resolved to
//     8192x4096 with a wrap-aware Lanczos-2 — true anti-aliasing on every neon edge,
//     rail, trail and star instead of the painter's one-axis coverage estimates;
//   * the noise tables are read with Catmull-Rom (no linear facets in the gradients);
//   * three clamped unsharp passes run AFTER the resolve at the shipped size, tuned on
//     the simulated in-game view (night_ingame_*.png: 1080p at cg_fov 65, bilinear);
//   * the EXR is written DIRECTLY as half floats by our own ZIP16 writer — the old
//     12-bit LUT -> 16-bit PNG -> ffmpeg chain quantised the dark sky to a few hundred
//     steps and banded the gradients; half keeps ~11 bits at every level;
//   * SKY_GAIN is SOLVED so the sky-light score lands on --target-score (0.478, the
//     v17.82 figure) instead of being hand-held — a picture change can no longer move
//     the world's lighting by accident. --gain still overrides.
//   Every feature COUNT and detail GATE keys on the SHIPPED pixel (PXO / OW), every
//   radius and line weight on the RENDER pixel (PX / LW = final weight x SS), so --ss
//   changes how cleanly the picture is resolved, never what is in it, and the 2048
//   preview now draws the SAME buildings as the 8192 ship (the old size gate was on W).
//
// ATMOSPHERE (v18.87, user: "make it even more atmospheric"): every surface is seen
// THROUGH three layers of air that each carry their own light —
//   GROUND MIST   a lit fog bank on the city plane (0..MIST_TOP), patchy in world XY,
//                 carrying the glow dome's colour per bearing: the feet of the towers
//                 and the far grid dissolve into lit haze, the reflections drown in it;
//   HAZE STRATA   two thin horizontal layers hanging BETWEEN the towers (z 560 / 1180)
//                 that a ray crosses on its way to a surface behind them — the towers
//                 read sliced by drifting bands of smog, the strongest depth cue there is;
//   MOON SHAFTS   crepuscular rays from the moon through the gaps of the low cloud deck;
//   THE STORM     one cell in the low deck far from the moon, lit from inside, with a
//                 single hazed bolt down to the far ring;
//   AIRSHIPS      two dirigibles over the mid city, dark hulls with a neon rim and a
//                 holo billboard on the flank, depth-tested against the towers.
//   All of it is a function of (azimuth, elevation) or world XY, so the seam is untouched.

// like stickers we just copied and placed". So: the GIANT sits LOW (el 12.5) and rises behind the far
// skyline through the horizon haze with a moonlet above it; every planet has an atmosphere limb and a
// scatter halo; the two holes are DIFFERENT DESIGNS — 'edge' (Gargantua: thin near-edge-on disc, lensed
// arch, warm) and 'face' (the Maelstrom: inclined spiral vortex, blue-white photon ring, POLAR JETS,
// violet) — both LENS the stars and nebula behind them (Einstein radius `lens`, in disc units) and both
// trail a gas halo out to 7 radii that fades into the nebula. The clouds pass in front of all of them.
// Bodies live in disc space (sdx, sdy) = angular offset / radius, x scaled by cos(el) so a disc is

// box: every antenna mast was a thin box, every setback a flat step, the ziggurat / arcology tapers were stacks of
// shrinking boxes. A PROFILE SOLID is the fix: its cross-section is a FUNCTION of height, sec(z) -> {cx, cy, hx, hy},
// and each column MARCHES z at ~2.5 samples per screen row solving the section analytically — a circle when o.round
// (masts, collars, spires: no faces, so no face-flip shading), otherwise an axis-aligned rectangle (sloped setbacks,
// pitched tops, tapering tiers). The columns the section only partly covers get FRACTIONAL coverage (covX), so a mast
// thins out instead of snapping off at a whole pixel. Shading is drawBox's own recipe (haze fill, window cells, the
// neon cell grid, corner + top/bottom rims, the veil, the emit) so a solid sits in the same light as the box it tops;
// round sections add a cylindrical falloff. drawBox itself is untouched — the box masses render as before.

// The reference's hero: a gantry over the arena with the title in lights and the planet rising behind it. Built as a
// STRUCTURE, not a sticker: two round masts (profile solids, in the skyline ledger), a top and a bottom truss band with
// chords and X-braces, a dark chamfered chassis between them, two side light bars, and the letters as NEON TUBES. The
// lettering comes from ANALYTIC DISTANCE FIELDS — every glyph is segments + circular arcs, so a bowl is a true curve at
// any zoom (the user's "actually curved lines" ask) — with a dark offset extrusion behind each tube for the 3D read.
// The chassis lives in its own vertical plane at SIGN_D, INSIDE the plaza (INNER_R 1100), so no building can stand in
// front of it: every pixel in its angular box is ray-cast onto that plane (exact projection), depth-tested and written.
// --sign-az <deg> turns it round the moon (0 = dead under the moon, the moon's lower limb behind the top truss like the
// reference's planet); --sign-mirror flips the lettering (a lat-long dome viewed from inside CAN read mirrored — if the
// title reads backwards in game, rebuild with the flag, nothing else moves); TOD_SKY_SKIP=sign drops the whole gantry.
