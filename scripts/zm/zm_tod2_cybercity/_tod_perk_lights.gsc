// _tod_perk_lights.gsc — perk machine + Pack-a-Punch GLOW when power turns on
// (server half). DIRECT PORT of map 1's _acc_perk_lights (the auras ARE the
// power visual — the stock off_model->on_model swap shows no visible delta in
// this build, refuted live on map 1).
//
// MECHANISM (map 1, root-caused): server-side PlayFX does NOT render in this
// build. The path that renders is the CLIENT VM: the SERVER (this file) only
// sets a per-machine "todPerkGlow" colour-index clientfield once the
// "power_on" flag is set; the CLIENT (_tod_perk_lights.csc) PlayFXOnTag's the
// looped glow FX. Registration MUST be in lockstep with the .csc twin
// (scope/name/version/bits/type identical or the bit layout desyncs).
//
// REKICK (map 1's Paradise lesson, generalized for a vertical tower): the
// clientfield LATCHES at power-on, but an FX spawned far from the viewer never
// becomes visible on approach. So each glow ent re-pulses ONCE the first time
// a player gets near it (edge-triggered, 0->idx a snapshot apart).

// SOLO QUICK REVIVE IS A PRICE FIX, NOT A GATE (v18.15).
//
// THE RULE, from the user 2026-09-07 after playing v18.14: "You should be able
// to buy a quick revive before turning on power on the solo. It should still be
// five hundred, and it should still work." That is also exactly what stock
// does, and it is classic-zombies tradition. This function exists ONLY to make
// the price and the sign correct; it must never stand between the player and
// the machine.
//
// TWO BUGS AND ONE SELF-INFLICTED REGRESSION, in order, because the shape of
// the mistake matters more than the fix:
//
// 1. v13.5/v13.6 tried to GATE this, to satisfy an older reading of the map
//    rule "every perk dark and unbuyable until the switch". It gated it by
//    writing `t.power_on = false` on the vending trigger, believing that field
//    "drives stock's native refusal AND the kit's Power Required card".
//    IT DRIVES NEITHER. In _zm_perks.gsc the buy loop (~:537-609) tests
//    HasPerk, custom_perk_validation, points and the perk limit and NEVER reads
//    .power_on; the field is read only at the end of vending_trigger_post_think
//    (~:659-665) — the "machine was powered down WHILE DRINKING" safety —
//    as `if ( !IS_TRUE( self.power_on ) ) { wait 1; perk_pause( ... ); }`.
//    So the sale went through and the perk was UnsetPerk'd a second later. In
//    solo the give hook had already run (self.lives = 1, solo_lives_given++)
//    and take_quick_revive_perk has an EMPTY body, so the player was left
//    holding a life with no perk: player_laststand (_zm.gsc:2521-2527) needs
//    BOTH, so the next down skipped last stand entirely and ended the run.
//    That is the Workshop report (fckspencer 2026-09-07, "quick revive not
//    working on solo ... i just die, no effect from quick revive").
//
// 2. v18.14 fixed the poisoning by TAKING THE TRIGGER OFF THE AIR until power
//    (TriggerEnable(false)). The perk stopped being stolen — and stopped being
//    BUYABLE, which nobody had asked for. The user found it in one session:
//    "that's a new regression just introduced." The error was treating a stale
//    design note in this file's own header as the requirement, instead of
//    asking what the behaviour should be. A ten-day-old bug does not license a
//    behaviour change smuggled in beside its fix.
//
// SO, NOW: no gate of any kind. .power_on is LEFT TRUE where stock stamps it
// (_zm_perk_quick_revive.gsc:202), which is what keeps the post-purchase pause
// from ever arming — that single non-write is the whole fix for bug 1. Do NOT
// write that field false here again, for any reason.
//
// WHAT IS STILL WORTH DOING, and why it has to wait for stock:
//   * THE PRICE. Stock registers QR's cost through revive_cost_override(),
//     which prices by GetPlayers().size — and at registration that count is
//     ZERO, so solo evaluates as "not solo" and 1500 sticks. Stock's own
//     repricer (update_quick_revive) runs only from the HOT-JOIN check, a
//     no-op in a solo game. The value is LATCHED onto the trigger as t.cost
//     (_zm_perks.gsc ~:496-500), so the fix must land on the trigger, not on
//     the _custom_perks table, and must land AFTER the latch.
//   * THE SIGN. Stock stamps the buy hint ONCE (~:528-531) with that same 1500
//     local and never re-stamps it — the think then parks in waittill("trigger")
//     forever. So v13.6 corrected the CHARGE and left the SIGN reading 1500,
//     which is the half the player actually reads. Re-stamped here with the
//     same hint_string and 500: one extra DISTINCT triggerstring for the match
//     (500 is a compile-time constant, so it can never mint a second).
//   * THE MESH. Solo QR is genuinely powered and selling from round 1, so it
//     should LOOK powered; coherence_pass already lights it off the same true
//     .power_on. The explicit SetModel is the immediate one, so the machine is
//     never briefly dark on a machine you can already use.
//
// The 10 s cap on the stamp wait is so a surprise flow can never hang us; if it
// expires we still write the price, which is strictly better than not.
// Co-op: untouched, and the function returns before doing anything.

	// coop"). The gate below used to be `GetPlayers().size != 1` evaluated the
	// instant the FIRST player existed — and in co-op the host exists alone for
	// a moment before the second client finishes connecting, so a two-player
	// game passed the solo test and this function then re-asserted 500 onto the

	// "start_zombie_round_logic", after SetHintString(&"ZOMBIE_NEED_POWER"), and

	// machine count and frame timing, so a single write is a coin flip, and it
	// came up tails in play.
	//
	// Re-asserting for 20 s is the honest fix: it cannot lose, and it costs
