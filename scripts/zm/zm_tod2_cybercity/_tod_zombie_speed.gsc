// _tod_zombie_speed.gsc — the tower speed curve (user spec 2026-08-17):
//
//   "Start them in the sprint animation but they will just move a bit slow.
//    Half sprint speed in sprint animation, ramp linearly to full sprint at
//    round 7. Then every round after that they gain 0.3% speed."
//
// Curve: EVERY zombie runs the SPRINT gait from round 1.
//   rounds 1..7:  playback rate 0.5 -> 1.0 linear (+1/12 per round)
//   rounds 8+:    rate 1.0 + 0.003 * (round - 7)   (unbounded; stock precedent
//                 for >1.0 rates: siegebot 1.429, apothicon 2.0)
//
// ENGINE MECHANISM (inherited from map 1's _acc_zombie_speed — do not re-learn):
// BO3 zombie movement is ROOT-MOTION / animation-driven; there is no "move at
// X%" knob. The two levers are the gait TIER (walk/run/sprint xanims, set via
// zombie_utility::set_zombie_run_cycle_override_value) and
// ASMSetAnimationRate(f) (playback rate — scales cadence AND ground speed by
// the same factor; rates < 1.0 therefore read as slow-motion sprinting, which
// is exactly the requested look here). SetMoveSpeedScale is PLAYER-only.
//
// KEEP-ALIVE (load-bearing, map 1 lesson): a one-shot run-cycle override
// DECAYS (stock re-evaluates locomotion and clobbers it) while the anim rate
// PERSISTS — a spawn-only application drifts to the wrong gait at our rate.
// So a 1.5s sweep continuously re-asserts gait + rate on every live zombie,
// skipping any zombie under an active slow (Widow's Wine / traps own the rate
// while running, then restore it) and anything boss-flagged (bosses drive
// custom locomotion ASMs — touching their speed freezes them; map 1's Brutus
// bug).

// (TOD_ZHEALTH_PER_PLAYER 0.15 lived here and is retired with v18.1's table —
// the asked-for set is not a constant step. The figures this comment used to
// quote, "solo 1.25 / duo 1.40 / trio 1.55 / quad 1.70", were already two
// base changes stale when they were read on 2026-09-06: a comment that quotes
// a computed set is a second source of truth that nothing regenerates. Read
// the four defines.)
// SUPERSEDED v10.26 - READ _tod_corpse_cleanup.gsc INSTEAD. It owns
// level.zombie_ai_limit, and since v18.11 that field is PARTY-AWARE again
// (ai_limit_for_party(), 30/35/40/45) with TOD_ACTOR_LIMIT 60 beside it. The
// defines and the function that used to sit here are gone - see the end of this
// block for what was kept and why.
//
// AND THE REASONING BELOW WAS PARTLY WRONG, which is worth leaving visible. It
// says "the true ceiling stays 31 no matter what this says" and that
// actor_limit must not be raised. Both stock values are only DEFAULTS - guarded
// by isdefined() at _zm.gsc:337-343, not engine limits - and map 1 has shipped
// 50/56 for months. What actually makes raising actor_limit safe is DELETING
// CORPSES, because get_current_actor_count() counts every body on the floor;
// without that, the raised cap just fills up with corpses instead of zombies.
// That is the whole reason _tod_corpse_cleanup exists and why both numbers live
// in one file with the delete that makes them safe.
//
// The original note, for the record:
// zombie_ai_limit by party size: 24 solo, +2 per extra player, capped 30.
//
// v18.11 — THE DEFINES AND coop_ai_limit() ARE DELETED. Party-aware concurrency
// came back, but in _tod_corpse_cleanup where the field's owner lives, so a
// second set of numbers here is exactly the drift this file spent forty lines
// warning about. The idea outlived the code: read ai_limit_for_party().
//
// ONE CLAUSE FROM THE DELETED BODY IS DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED — it clamped the
// limit to 27 during the finale, because "up to 4 bosses share stock's 31-actor
// gate with the horde". That premise is retired: the actor gate is
// TOD_ACTOR_LIMIT 60 now, and corpses are deleted rather than left to fill it,
// which is the change that made the higher ceiling safe. If the finale ever does
// busy-loop against the gate again, the clause belongs in ai_limit_for_party().

// THE ELITE SLOW (v17.84, user 2026-09-05: TRAILBLAZER "should slow elites but
// not burn them"). slow() above REFUSES anything boss-flagged and always will:
// the sweep, the gait override and slow_mult() are the horde's lane and an
// elite drives a custom locomotion ASM. This is a SEPARATE, NARROWER lane —
// no gait, no sweep, no slow_mult, just a timed playback rate and a restore.
//
// WHY THIS IS SAFE, AND IT IS NOT AN ASSUMPTION: the upgrade pause already
// writes ASMSetAnimationRate( 0.05 ) on EVERY axis AI including all four
// elites (_tod_upgrades.gsc set_world_pause), and every one of them threads
// tod_bosses::boss_pause_watch, which restores its own base rate on the
// unpause edge. Every card event in this map's history has slowed the Panzer,
// the Protector, the Reaver and the hounds to 5% and put them back. A 34%
// slow for 1.2 s is the same lever, gentler.
//
// THE BASE RATE COMES FROM ONE STAMP. boss_pause_watch already receives each
// elite's true rate (1.0 hound/Reaver, TOD_PANZER_ANIM_RATE, TOD_RP_ANIM_RATE)
// and now records it as .tod_elite_base_rate — so the restore here can never
// drift from the pause watcher's restore. Deliberately NOT .tod_base_rate:
// that field is also the gate that picks a sky-drop relocation over a ground
// tell (_tod_bosses.gsc ~:1018), and stamping it on a hound or a Reaver would
// silently give them an entrance they are not built for.
//
// WE NEVER FIGHT AN OWNER. Three states own an elite's rate outright — the
// drop-in entrance (tod_dropping), the upgrade pause and a menu freeze — and
// this lane declines to write in all three, on the way in AND on the way out.
// The cost of losing to them is one lapsed slow; TRAILBLAZER re-applies every
// 500 ms tick a zombie stands in fire.
