// =============================================================================
// _tod_riotshield.gsc — RIOT SHIELD, the universal five-level shield upgrade
//
// v16.63 (user 2026-09-02): "I want to add a riot shield to the map. It is for
// all classes and has 5 levels. Each level increasing the health and decreasing
// the recharge. Once it breaks it needs to be recharged and you will get it
// back automatically. ... abandoned cyber city had a riot shield so we can use
// that exact one. There is a base riot shield and then one new model. New
// model will be used at max tier."
//
// HOW IT PLAYS
//   Own one level of the RIOT SHIELD domain (id 45, every class rolls it) and a
//   shield rides in your equipment slot (d-pad DOWN swaps to it, like every stock
//   zombies shield). Held, it blocks everything in front; on your back it blocks
//   everything behind (stock rules, untouched). It has its own health bar under
//   the HUD health bar. When its health hits zero it breaks and is GONE, and a
//   per-player recharge starts; when the recharge runs out the shield is handed
//   straight back, full, no purchase, no station. THE LADDER (the user's table,
//   verbatim — TOD_SHIELD_HP_L* / TOD_SHIELD_RECHARGE_L* below):
//       Lv1  200 HP   4:00        Lv4  450 HP   2:30
//       Lv2  300 HP   3:30        Lv5  500 HP   2:00  + THE NEW MODEL
//       Lv3  370 HP   3:00
//   Lv5 also swaps the shield for the second model (the clean cyber shield —
//   Logical's mesh, the one map 1 reskinned its shield with).
//   TAKING A CARD REFILLS THE SHIELD YOU ARE CARRYING (v17.11, user 2026-09-04)
//   — to the NEW maximum, so a battered Lv2 shield comes out of the deal as a
//   full Lv3 one. The dark rung refills it too (it raises the same number).
//   A card taken while the shield is RECHARGING shortens the wait instead; it
//   can never lengthen one.
//   THE DARK RUNG (700 HP / 1:30) ALSO TAKES 2 SECONDS OFF A RUNNING RECHARGE
//   FOR EVERY ELITE YOU KILL (v17.16, user 2026-09-04) — dark holders only,
//   killer only, and only against a clock that is running. See elite_kill().
//   THE RETURN VERIFIES ITSELF (v17.16), and reconcile() sweeps a DEAD SHIELD —
//   one left in the inventory with stock's flags cleared, which used to make
//   every later reconcile think the slot was full. See shield_is_dead().
//
// THE PORT (map 1, _acc_boss_items.gsc apply_rocket_shield .. regrant_on_destroy)
//   Map 1 never wrote a shield of its own: it grants the STOCK Shadows of Evil
//   rocket shield (`zod_riotshield`, weapon def shipped in zm_levelcommon,
//   equipment registration free from stock zm_usermap's #using of
//   _zm_weap_rocketshield) and adds exactly three things, all kept here:
//     1. an EFFECTIVE-HP SCALER. The shield's real health pool is the weapon
//        def's weaponStartHitPoints, burned engine-side by DamageRiotShield
//        with NO runtime setter. So every blocked hit is scaled UP by
//        (pool / wanted HP) before it reaches the stock damage function, and
//        the pool then empties over exactly `wanted HP` of real damage. The
//        HUD bar stays a true fraction by construction. THIS IS WHAT LETS ONE
//        WEAPON ASSET CARRY FIVE HEALTH LEVELS — five per-level assets would be
//        five weapon registrations against a ledger that sits on its guard.
//        The seam is the per-player pointer self.player_shield_apply_damage
//        (the stock design's own override hook, _zm_weap_riotshield.gsc:92).
//        ⚠️ _zm_weap_rocketshield::on_player_spawned RE-STOMPS that pointer to
//        the stock function on EVERY spawn — so install_scaler() runs on every
//        reconcile, and the spawn reconcile waits for stock to settle first.
//        Shield BASHES stay stock-priced on purpose (riotshield_melee calls
//        player_damage_shield DIRECTLY, not through the pointer): a bash costs
//        the same fraction of the bar at every level; only enemy damage burns
//        the smaller pool. Map 1 shipped exactly this.
//     2. BREAK DETECTION on stock's own "destroy_riotshield" notify (the first
//        line of riotshield::player_take_riotshield, which stock threads the
//        moment the pool hits zero).
//     3. RE-GRANT: map 1's flat 60 s regrant thread is now the LEVEL LADDER
//        above, and the timer is per-player state that survives a down, a
//        bleed-out and a respawn (it is stamped on the player entity, which is
//        never deleted) — you come back from a death with whatever recharge you
//        had left, not a fresh shield and not a reset clock.
//
// WHY A RECONCILE (the DISTRACTION shape, _tod_distraction.gsc)
//   Equipment is INVENTORY and inventory does not survive a spawn. THREE paths
//   write a domain level without ever calling apply_upgrade (tier_up's reset
//   loop, tier_up's grant field, the dev grant), and a one-shot "on card pick"
//   hook is skipped by all of them. So the effect is a reconcile: read the
//   level, make the equipment slot match. Idempotent, called on every spawn, by
//   _tod_upgrades after every level write (through level.tod_shield_reconcile —
//   _tod_upgrades can never #using us, we import IT for get_level), and by a
//   slow per-player maintain so no stock strip path can leave a Lv3 player
//   shieldless for a round.
//
// THE TWO WEAPONS
//   Lv1-4  zod_riotshield     stock SoE rocket shield: def + models from
//                              zm_levelcommon, equipment-registered by stock.
//                              NOT a zone line, NOT a ledger entry — the CSV row
//                              that was always in zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv
//                              is its inclusion lane (the cymbal-monkey rule).
//   Lv5    log_riotshield_zm  Logical's standalone "Riot Shield" weapon def
//                              (bulletweapon, weaponType riotshield, 1500 HP,
//                              gunModel/worldModel logical_m_shield_full, the
//                              stock vm_riotshield_zm_* anim set, dpad icon
//                              riotshield_zm_icon). It lives in the Logical
//                              pack's own GDT under <BO3>/model_export/
//                              _logical_models/ (the gdtdb scans model_export
//                              GDTs — map 1's manifest note), which is why it
//                              needs a `weapon,` zone line here and pays ONE
//                              registration (LEDGER_GUARD 223 -> 224). Map 1
//                              used the SAME mesh a different way — six xmodel
//                              blocks SHADOWING the stock rocket-shield model
//                              names — but a shadow replaces the look for BOTH
//                              stock forms, and this map needs two looks.
//                              Registered as equipment here in init() exactly
//                              the way stock registers zod_riotshield.
//   The swap at Lv5 is take-then-buy INSIDE a latch (tod_shield_swapping) so
//   the take's stock notify cannot be mistaken for a break.
//
// WHAT IS FREE. Blocking, the back-stow, the d-pad slot, the HUD health bar
// (Aetherium's AetheriumPlayerInfo.lua already subscribes zmInventory.shield_health
// through Engine.CreateModel — that fix rode in from map 1 on 2026-08-26 and
// has waited for a shield ever since), the break sounds, the bash. Nothing here
// registers a clientfield, mints a hint string or adds a twin.
