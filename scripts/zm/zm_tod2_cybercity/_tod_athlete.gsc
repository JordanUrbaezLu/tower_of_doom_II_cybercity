// =============================================================================
// _tod_athlete.gsc — ATHLETE, the SLASHER's mobility upgrade (domain 43)
//
// v16    (2026-09-01): "a new upgrade to melee where they can slide faster and
//         jump higher ... called athlete ... 5 tiers 10% slide speed each tier
//         and 25% jump height increase each tier" + "make it so that you dont
//         really lose speed when you jump out of a slide and you have athlete".
// v16.1  (2026-09-01, after the user PLAYED v16): "that slide speed boost never
//         transfers momentum properly to the jump so you slow down a ton" —
//         jump_max_velocity found and set to 1000 (the mistake, see v16.31).
// v16.23 (2026-09-02, after the user PLAYED v16.21): "athlete is not so smooth.
//         It kind of speed boosts when you jump out of a slide ... It also
//         needs more aerial handling meaning you can keep velocity but change
//         directions in the air very very easily ... increases with each
//         level ... comical for now ... Smoothness should not be comical."
// v16.24 (2026-09-02, after the user PLAYED v16.23): "its for sure comical.
//         But we know its possible. Now its about smoothing it out and making
//         it make sense ... keep max momentum up to 120 degrees in front of
//         them ... poll every 10ms ... i can slide and then go backwards max
//         speed. Obviously that doesnt make sense."
// v16.28 (2026-09-02, fresh-eyes review; user: "Do what ever players would
//         find intuitive and a bit beyond that to make it fun.") Six fixes.
// v16.31 (2026-09-02, after the user PLAYED v16.28): "When jumping out of my
//         slide im launching. We need a creative way to keep the speed of the
//         player throught the slide jump with calculations or something ...
//         Still feels like i slide then jump and my jump is launching me in
//         the direction. Like its a stutter step and randomly gain speed".
//         And, to be clear: "this really only needs to apply to players with
//         athlete. I have no complains about how it works without athlete ...
//         All these changes are for the athlete upgrade." — so EVERY engine
//         dvar this file touches now rests at STOCK and moves only while an
//         athlete is in the state that consumes it.
// v16.33 (2026-09-02, after the user PLAYED v16.31): "Still not super smooth
//         you should be able to change direction as much. here should be a
//         max steer limit. Also still kinda launching. I think it got better
//         tho." — a hard STEER BUDGET per air episode, a lower eased rate, and
//         the cap PRE-ARMED while an athlete is grounded (the first-50 ms hop
//         was launching against a poisoned rest value; see PRE-ARM below).
// v16.34 (2026-09-02): "Any chance of adding wall running for athlete?" —
//         EXPERIMENTAL WALL-RUN, athletes only (see WALL-RUN below). UNPLAYED.
//
// HOW IT PLAYS (per level, additive across levels)
//   * slides start 10% faster (so they also run longer);
//   * jumps go 25% higher;
//   * a jump straight out of a slide leaves the ground at EXACTLY the slide's
//     speed and rises to exactly the level's height, with no script write at
//     all — the engine does both, client-predicted (lane 1, v16.31);
//   * IN THE AIR you steer with the STRAFE axis: push left/right and your
//     velocity heading curves that way (relative to where you look) at
//     90 + 30/Lv deg/s (120 .. 240), eased, speed unchanged, and BY AT MOST
//     20 + 8/Lv degrees (28 .. 60) off the line you launched on — the steer
//     budget of that jump. Forward/back on the stick never steer — aiming
//     behind you while you hop away does not pull you back into the horde;
//   * momentum is FREE anywhere in the front hemisphere of your launch line
//     (the cone; inert under a 60-deg budget, kept as the safety net);
//   * (v16.34, experimental) you can WALL-RUN: jump at a wall and run along
//     it — the engine's own BO3 wall-run, switched off for zombies by stock
//     and switched back on here for athletes only.
//   Every script write in this file has a `self` receiver; the three engine
//   dvars are written just-in-time (below) so they act on one player at a time.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WALL-RUN (v16.34, EXPERIMENTAL — read this before trusting it)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// BO3's wall-run is an ENGINE feature (the MP advanced movement). Stock zombies
// turns it off with one line, `SetDvar( "wallrun_enabled", 0 )` in _zm.gsc:221,
// beside doublejump / juke / sprintLeap / playerEnergy. The API also carries a
// PER-PLAYER gate, `<player> AllowWallRun( <on off> )` ("Sets whether the
// player can wall run"), and a server-side `IsWallRunning()`. So:
//   * the master switch goes back to 1 for the match (probe-first),
//   * EVERY player is denied at spawn (AllowWallRun false, before the watcher's
//     first tick), and the watcher allows it only while the ATHLETE level is
//     above 0 — re-applied whenever the cached state disagrees, and the cache
//     is cleared on every spawn in case stock resets the flag,
//   * while IsWallRunning() the engine owns movement: this file publishes
//     "airborne" (the stumble lane), parks lanes 3 and 4, and the tick after
//     the run ends starts a fresh air episode with NO edge — the wall-jump off
//     the wall is the engine's own launch (wallRun_jumpHeight /
//     wallRun_jumpVelocity), never multiplied or insured.
// WHAT IS NOT KNOWN (one dev test answers all of it; the dev print now lists
// the wallRun_* family): whether the engine's initiation rules, tuned for MP
// boost-jumps — wallRun_minJumpHeight(Enable), wallRun_peakTest,
// wallRun_minTriggerSpeed, wallRun_minZVel — let a zombies jump attach at all
// (the athlete's 2.25x jump helps); whether the zombies player animation set
// has wall-run states (first person is camera roll + viewmodel; third person
// matters in co-op); and whether playerEnergy_enabled 0 leaves the run bounded
// by wallRun_maxTimeMs alone. Geometry is fine: every parapet carries a 112
// clip cap and every door an anti-vault clip, so a wall-run cannot leave a
// flight or pass a shut door. TOD_ATH_WALLRUN 0 removes the whole lane.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE v16.31 FINDING — jump_max_velocity IS THE SLIDE-JUMP LAUNCH SPEED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Treyarch: "The max velocity of the players jump if they enter it from a
// slide." v16.1 read that as a CLAMP on the slider's own speed and set it to
// 1000 so the clamp "stopped". The complaint pattern says otherwise:
//   engine default (v16)  -> "you slow down a ton"      (launch = the default)
//   1000 (v16.21)         -> "kind of speed boosts"     (launch up to 1000, the
//                                                        script cut it a tick later)
//   1000, no cut (v16.28) -> "launching ... stutter step and randomly gain speed"
// The engine LAUNCHES a slide-jump at up to jump_max_velocity — an assignment
// or a cap on its own boost, the trace's `jmv=` vs `launch=` tells which — and
// it does so on the CLIENT, at frame rate. A script that notices one server
// frame later and cuts the speed back is the "stutter step"; without the cut
// it is the "launch". So the value must be RIGHT BEFORE THE JUMP, and "right"
// is a per-player number (the slider's own speed). The dvar is global.
//
// THE JUST-IN-TIME RULE (lane 1): a global dvar becomes per-player if it is
// written from the one player who is in the state that consumes it, every
// frame of that state, and rested otherwise. A slide-jump can only happen
// while sliding, so every SLIDING tick of an athlete writes
//   jump_max_velocity = that player's current horizontal speed
//   jump_height       = the engine's base height x (1 + 0.25 * Lv)
// and the first non-sliding tick rests both at the engine's PRISTINE defaults.
// The engine's own launch is then the slide speed and the level's height, by
// construction, client-predicted, zero script writes on the slide-jump. The
// same rule carries the landing stumble (jump_slowdownEnable, off since v16.2
// on the user's "forward velocity" steer): OFF while an athlete is airborne,
// stock otherwise. In co-op the values are the MAX over everyone currently in
// the state (jit_update); the exposure is a non-athlete slide-jumping INSIDE
// an athlete's slide (~0.5 s windows) or landing inside an athlete's flight
// (~1 s windows) getting the athlete's numbers — the script insurance below
// cannot see a non-athlete, so that is the accepted cost, documented in
// docs/62 §9.9. The rest values are STOCK — which also undoes v16.1/v16.2's
// silent whole-map changes (every class launched at up to 1000 out of a slide
// and lost its landing stumble from v16.1 to v16.28, and nobody but the
// slasher was tested). User 2026-09-02: "this really only needs to apply to
// players with athlete."
//
// PRISTINE CAPTURE: dvars persist across map loads within one GAME session,
// so the value read at init may be OUR previous write. The first init of a
// game session (no tod_ath_jit_written marker yet) stores the live values in
// script dvars (tod_ath_orig_*) and every later init reads THOSE and never
// captures again. A session that already ran v16.1..v16.28 has 1000 live at
// its first capture: that value is REFUSED (v16.33), forgotten, and the rest
// falls back to the engine's own slide_speedBase (then 400) until the game is
// restarted and a clean capture happens. The dev print reports all of it.
//
// PRE-ARM (v16.33 — "still kinda launching"): the watcher only sees a slide
// on the first SERVER tick after it began, so a slide-hop pressed inside the
// slide's first 50 ms launches against whatever the cap was BEFORE the slide.
// With a poisoned rest that was 1000 — a rocket, "randomly". While an athlete
// is grounded the cap is now held at the engine's own slide start speed (the
// measured slide_ref, else slide_speedBase), so that early hop keeps exactly
// the speed it had — the lane-2 multiply had not landed either. The height is
// NOT pre-armed: jump_height would then boost every jump of every player
// while an athlete stands anywhere, which is the whole-map change the user
// ruled out; an early hop gets the one-frame vz multiply instead.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE MODEL — momentum is PRESERVED at every edge, never ADDED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The only speed source above sprint is the slide-start multiply (the spec).
// Every other write either copies the current magnitude (steering), trims it
// (the cone), or — insurance only — restores the slide's magnitude when the
// engine's launch disagrees with it by more than friction can explain.
//
// LANE 1 — ENGINE, just-in-time (above), three dvars: jump_max_velocity and
//   jump_height while an athlete SLIDES, jump_slowdownEnable while an athlete
//   is AIRBORNE. Probe-first: an unregistered dvar is never written (SetDvar
//   would mint a dead script dvar and look like success) and that lane simply
//   stays off.
//
// LANE 2 — SCRIPT, per player, the SLIDE START: on the first sliding tick the
//   horizontal velocity becomes BASE x (1 + 0.10*Lv), one-shot (sliding writes
//   stick — map 1 measured this — so a per-tick multiply would compound).
//   THE CLEAN-ENTRY RULE: if the player entered the slide from a normal speed
//   (previous tick under TOD_ATH_CLEAN_ENTRY), BASE is what the engine started
//   THIS slide at, and that number is remembered as the player's slide
//   reference. If they entered it FAST (a slide-jump landing rolled straight
//   into a slide), BASE is the remembered reference, raise-only. ONE dev
//   reading retires this rule if `eng` is constant across slides (docs/62 §9.5).
//
// LANE 3 — SCRIPT, per player, THE JUMP EDGE. An edge is ground->air, or
//   air->air with vz rising by TOD_ATH_HOP_DVZ (the bunny hop), inside the
//   engine's launch band, WITH a jump press inside TOD_ATH_JUMP_LATCH_MS.
//   Modes: "slide" (the previous tick was sliding — lane 1 was in force at the
//   launch), "standup" (within TOD_ATH_DIRECT_MS of a slide but grounded
//   frames in between — the engine treats it as a normal jump), "run", "hop".
//   * height: the vz multiply (z only, sqrt of the height factor) on every
//     mode EXCEPT "slide" when the JIT height lane is on — the engine already
//     launched at the boosted height and a write would double it;
//   * INSURANCE, "slide" only: the launch should equal the last sliding tick's
//     speed (that is what lane 1 wrote). More than TOD_ATH_EDGE_BOOST above it
//     means lane 1 was not in force (unregistered, or a remote client's copy
//     lagging) and the speed is cut back; more than TOD_ATH_EDGE_CLAMP below it
//     is a shortfall friction cannot produce and the speed is put back. Either
//     write is one frame late — the stutter — so they exist to be measured
//     (`launch=B>A`, B==A is the success signature), not to be relied on.
//
// LANE 4 — SCRIPT, per player, STRAFE STEERING + THE STEER BUDGET + THE CONE:
//   every airborne tick the strafe axis of the movement stick
//   (GetNormalizedMovement()[1] — the LEFT stick / A-D, confirmed live in
//   v16.23) becomes a wish direction to the left or right OF THE VIEW, and the
//   velocity HEADING rotates toward it by up to (TOD_ATH_AIR_TURN_BASE +
//   TOD_ATH_AIR_TURN_PER_LV * Lv) * deflection * tick degrees, EASED (never
//   more than TOD_ATH_AIR_EASE of the remaining gap in one frame, so the curve
//   arrives instead of snapping), inside a TOD_ATH_AIR_DEADBAND, and NEVER
//   further than (TOD_ATH_AIR_STEER_MAX_BASE + TOD_ATH_AIR_STEER_MAX_PER_LV *
//   Lv) degrees from the heading the air episode began on — the STEER BUDGET
//   (v16.33, user: "there should be a max steer limit"). The magnitude is
//   untouched by the rotation. THE CONE: every air episode is ANCHORED on the heading and
//   speed it began with (its first airborne tick; re-anchored if an external
//   impulse throws the speed past cap x TOD_ATH_AIR_REANCHOR). The cap =
//   launch speed x air_retain(deviation from the anchor): 1.0 in the front
//   hemisphere, linear to TOD_ATH_AIR_REVERSE_KEEP at 180 deg, never under
//   TOD_ATH_AIR_CAP_FLOOR. Speed above the cap is trimmed.
//   THERE IS NO 10 ms LANE (the user asked for one): the server frame is 50 ms
//   (shared.gsh:264 `SERVER_FRAME .05`), every script wait rounds up to it, no
//   faster wait exists in T7 GSC, and Treyarch's dvar table carries no server
//   tick-rate dvar. Smoothness is STEP SIZE PER FRAME and FEWER WRITES — which
//   is exactly why v16.31 moved the slide-jump off script entirely.
//   WHY A SERVER ROTATION AND NOT THE ENGINE'S OWN AIR CONTROL: the engine's
//   air accelerate rides the move-speed scale, which ALSO drives ground
//   acceleration and is still in force on the landing frames until the server
//   sees the landing — at the scales this needs, a landing rocket. An analysis,
//   not a measurement; worth one dev jump before it is called dead for good.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASUREMENT (tod_dev builds only — the ship state prints nothing)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   * dev_print_movement_dvars() at the dev block in _tod_main::init — now also
//     the two JIT lanes: live value, rest value, pristine value, and the
//     POISONED warning.
//   * One bold line per slide: "ATH slide eng=E set=S next=N end=Z Tms
//     clean=C ref=R".
//   * One bold line per air episode that began with an edge: "ATH jump
//     slide|standup|run|hop|nojump pre=P jmv=J jh=H launch=B>A vz=V minair=M
//     air=Nt turn=T/Smax strafe=R dev=D keep=K% land=L +300ms=Q". On a "slide"
//     line: B == P == J is lane 1 working (the engine launched at the slide
//     speed); B == J != P means the dvar is an ASSIGNMENT and P was stale;
//     B >> J means the dvar is not in force on this host; A != B means the
//     insurance wrote (the stutter). "nojump" while sprinting up a flight is
//     the crest-hop measurement.
//
