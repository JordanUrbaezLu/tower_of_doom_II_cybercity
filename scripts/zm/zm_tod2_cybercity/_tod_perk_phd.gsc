// _tod_perk_phd.gsc — PhD FLOPPER, replacing Mule Kick on the crown.
//
// (user 2026-08-25: "We need to take out mule kick and replace with a perk that
// makes sense" -> "We can add PHD. Make sure all the UI is implemented
// correctly and everything. Its from Map 1 so we should be easy here".)
//
// WHY MULE KICK HAD TO GO, and it is not taste. Mule Kick's third weapon slot is
// NOT granted by its perk threads — those are empty — it comes from a direct
// HasPerk check inside stock get_player_weapon_limit (_zm_utility.gsc:5866).
// This map carries exactly two primaries by design (class gun + tier sidearm),
// runs with the stock too-many-weapons monitor DELIBERATELY OFF (v9.18), and
// _tod_upgrades::reconcile_twin's own comment names the hazard: "a third primary
// = the engine silently drops one: the inventory-overflow trap". Mule Kick was
// arming that trap on every player who bought it.
//
// WHY PhD FITS THIS MAP SPECIFICALLY: it is a 50-floor open-air tower with a
// 19,200-unit drop, so FALL DAMAGE is the signature hazard — and the heavy's
// tier-2 sidearm is an RPG with a 250-unit blast whose self-damage is a known,
// accepted sharp edge (see the RPG entry in tools/gen_tod_twins.js). PhD answers
// both with one perk.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PIPELINE: registered OVER stock `specialty_electriccherry`, and that is
// free real estate ON THIS MAP even though it would not be on map 1.
//
// Read this before "fixing" the apparent contradiction: this map DOES have an
// Electric Cherry, but it lives on `specialty_combat_efficiency` — a from-
// scratch registration in _tod_perk_electric_cherry.gsc. The STOCK cherry
// specialty is therefore fully registered (the entry script #usings
// _zm_perk_electric_cherry for its tesla-FX functions, and its REGISTER_SYSTEM
// runs the whole 6-call chain) and COMPLETELY UNUSED. So PhD inherits a working
// machine/bottle/clientfield/power scaffold for free and collides with nothing.
//
// This is the same hijack map 1 used (_acc_perk_phd_flopper.gsc) — there it was
// forced, because specialty_phdflopper is a zero-init stub in BO3 with no stock
// ability and no shipped vending model. Nothing here changes that; we simply
// arrive at the same door from the other side.
//
// The perk's underlying specialty stays PERK_ELECTRIC_CHERRY for all
// HasPerk / rotation / HUD plumbing; only PRESENTATION (icon, name, hint, cost)
// and ABILITY are PhD.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT WAS DROPPED FROM MAP 1'S VERSION, deliberately:
//   * the MEGA tier ("PhD Slider") and its slide-to-explode nova — this map has
//     NO Mega Bottles (CLAUDE.md), so has_mega_perk has no meaning here. Map 1
//     gated the slide nova to Mega only, which means BASE PhD there behaved
//     exactly as it does here: immunity + explode-on-down.
//   * _acc_coop_scaling::regular_hp_mult() — that scaled the FROZEN Mega nova
//     damage, and there is no frozen Mega damage without a Mega tier.
// If you ever want the slide nova on base, map 1's phd_slide_watcher() is the
// recipe: trigger off the engine isSliding() (BO3 zombies has the sprint-slide
// but NO dolphin-dive), on a cooldown so it is not a spammable free AOE.

// PhD GRENADES (v16.48, user 2026-09-02: "PHD is not that important on this
// map. Can we add PHD grenades then? Typically grenades get a buff when this
// happens on other custom maps").
//
// The honest read of PhD on this map: fall immunity matters on a 50-floor
// tower, self-explosive immunity matters to exactly one sidearm (the heavy's
// RPG), and the down-flop fires once per down. A perk you buy on the roof
// deserves a reason to exist every round. So: while you hold PhD, every LETHAL
// grenade you throw detonates as a flop nova at its impact point — the perk's
// own explosion FX + earthquake, and every non-boss zombie within
// TOD_PHD_EXPLODE_RADIUS takes TOD_PHD_GRENADE_HEALTH_FRAC of the round's
// zombie health (floor TOD_PHD_EXPLODE_DAMAGE) ON TOP of the frag's own
// damage. At 0.5 two frags clear a crowd at any round; the down-flop keeps its
// full 1.0. Kill credit is the thrower's (DoDamage attacker), so points, luck
// and the elite reward flow as for any grenade kill.
//
// HOW IT IS WIRED: give_phd threads phd_grenade_watcher on the holder; it
// listens on the engine's "grenade_fire" (grenade, weapon) notify — the same
// contract stock's beginGrenadeTracking rides — keeps ONLY the player's lethal
// (zm_utility::get_player_lethal_grenade; the tactical is DISTRACTION's decoy
// and must stay a decoy), and threads phd_grenade_track ON THE GRENADE so a
// deleted grenade ends the wait instead of leaking a thread. take_phd's
// existing "tod_phd_stop" notify ends the watcher, and a HasPerk check at the
// explosion covers a perk lost mid-flight. Self-damage is already zero through
// phd_damage_override, so the classic feet-frag works.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#define TOD_PHD_GRENADE             1     // 1 = a PhD holder's lethal grenades detonate as flop novas; 0 = the v16.47 perk (immunity + down-flop only)

// v16.57 PhD + WIDOW'S WINE (user 2026-09-02: "PHD Flopper Widow's Wine combo
// doesn't work. Typically they will expand out into children and turn into
// like a web of grenades"): a holder of BOTH perks throws a Widow's grenade
// that, at its impact, SPLITS into child Widow's grenades launched in an even
// ring (MagicGrenadeType as the thrower — the same call stock's
// contact-explosion lane uses, so kills, cocoons and the elite reward credit
// the player), each detonating on its own short fuse into its own web — a web
// of grenades around the flop nova. Children are FREE (no clip cost). Gated on
// the thrown weapon BEING the Widow's grenade (stock swaps it in as the lethal
// on the buy), not on the perk alone.
//
// v16.70 THE NEST IS EXPLICIT AND BOUNDED (user 2026-09-03: "I think we have
// them infinite and they should nest at 3 levels max"). v16.57 claimed the
// children "NEVER split again: MagicGrenadeType raises no grenade_fire on the
// player, so the watcher never sees them — no recursion by construction". That
// was an assumption about the engine that nobody had watched hold, and the
// first real throw is the evidence against it: if the engine DOES raise
// "grenade_fire" for a script-launched grenade (it is the owner's grenade, and
// stock's own multi-detonation lane in shared/weapons/_weapons.gsc guards its
// children by giving them a DIFFERENT weapon, not by trusting silence), every
// child was a fresh lethal to the watcher — 6 more per burst per second,
// without end. So the recursion is now DECLARED, not inferred from what the
// engine will or will not notify:
//   * every tracked grenade carries its GENERATION: 1 = the thrown grenade,
//     2 = its children, 3 = theirs. A grenade splits only while its generation
//     is below TOD_PHD_WIDOW_DEPTH, so the cascade is finite by arithmetic;
//   * CHILDREN ARE RECOGNISED BY A STAMP ON THE ENTITY, never by timing.
//     v16.70 tried "one tracker per grenade, last one wins": the split
//     threaded its tracker AFTER MagicGrenadeType returned, betting that any
//     grenade_fire the engine raised for the child had already fired. The
//     v16.72 build proved the bet wrong (user: "I threw one and it never
//     stopped spreading"): the engine DOES raise grenade_fire for a
//     script-launched grenade, and it raises it LATER — on a following
//     frame — so the watcher's generation-1 tracker arrived last, won the
//     dedupe, and every child was a fresh throw again. Now (v16.78):
//       - phd_widow_split stamps `child.tod_phd_gen` on the entity the
//         MagicGrenadeType call returns (stock reads that return value too,
//         _zm_craftables.gsc:883), and the watcher SKIPS any grenade that
//         already carries the stamp — the deferred notify finds it tagged;
//       - for the other ordering (a notify raised INSIDE the call, before the
//         stamp can land) the split declares how many children it is about to
//         launch (`tod_phd_child_pending`, a TOD_PHD_WIDOW_CHILD_WINDOW_MS
//         window) and the watcher consumes those first;
//       - and phd_grenade_track REFUSES TO DOWNGRADE: a tracker may never set
//         a lower generation than the entity already carries, so a stray
//         generation-1 tracker on a stamped child is a no-op. Three
//         independent layers; the cascade needs all three to fail at once;
//   * the flop nova fires for the THROWN grenade only. A nova per child was
//     the other half of what made the runaway cascade unplayable — 25 novas at
//     half the round's health each is not a perk, it is a wipe button.
// v16.72 (user 2026-09-03: "the widow's grenade when you also have phd will
// explode into 8 minigrenades when it explodes that also explode"): EIGHT on
// the first burst. Searched for a source to match — BO3 stock and Zombies
// Chronicles (Widow's REPLACED PhD there), BO6 (no Widow's), BO7 (both perks,
// eight augments each: PhD = Double Whammy / Slider / Dr Ram / Gravity MD,
// Widow's = Tangled Web / Web Spinner / Hatchling (a spider ally) / Widow's
// Bite + minors), the Modme and Workshop PhD packs — nothing anywhere splits
// a Widow's grenade. The nearest official thing is BO4's Cluster Grenade (one
// lethal → a ring of minis that each explode), which is the shape built here.
// "MINI" IS NOT LITERAL: a child is a full Widow's grenade (same model, blast
// and web) launched by MagicGrenadeType; a physically smaller child needs a
// second weapon asset, and the weapon ledger sits at its 223/224 ceiling
// (LEDGER_GUARD, tools/gen_tod_twins.js) — not a lane this map has.
// THE SHIPPED SHAPE (user 2026-09-03, final word: "one grenade and 8 children
