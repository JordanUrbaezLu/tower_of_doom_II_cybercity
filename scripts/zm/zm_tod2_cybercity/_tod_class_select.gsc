// _tod_class_select.gsc — the game-start class draft (user 2026-08-19: "each
// player must select a class before the game starts. That will be 60s max (was 30s until v15)
// unless everyone selected. If not selected itll pick a random class").
//
// Flow: after the intro blackscreen, the world pauses (the SAME
// set_world_pause the upgrade events use — round-1 spawning holds on the
// stock world_is_paused flag), every player gets the 4-card class panel
// (tod_class_select.lua). Lock or 60s timeout (random class) — when everyone
// is done the world unpauses and round 1 begins. Players who lock early get
// their controls back; the pick is PERMANENT (stations removed 2026-08-20).
//
// CLIENTFIELD BUDGET (the 2026-08-19 overflow lesson — map load ABORTS to
// the lobby when clientuimodel overflows): this panel owns only todClsShow
// (2 bits). Focus, countdown and the hold bar RIDE the upgrade panel's
// todUpgFocus / todUpgTime / todUpgHold — the two panels are never on screen
// together (draft = pre-round-1; upgrades = round 2+), and each Lua hides
// itself unless its own Show field is live. The countdown is HALVED into the
// 4-bit todUpgTime (60s -> 15 at quarter-second resolution; the Lua displays x4). The picked class is
// whatever todUpgFocus holds when todClsShow goes to 2.
//
// Class ids: 1 NECROMANCER / 2 ASSAULT (Archer) / 3 HEAVY (Breacher) / 4 SLASHER (Warrior)
// — MUST mirror tod_class_select.lua's CLASSES table and class_key() below.

// THE DRAFT IS 60 SECONDS (v15 item 17, user 2026-08-31: "Change class
// selection to 1 minute"). Was 30.
//
// ⚠️ THIS NUMBER IS CONSTRAINED BY A CLIENTFIELD, NOT BY TASTE. todUpgTime is a
// FOUR-BIT field (max 15) and the countdown is encoded into it by division, so
// the timeout must divide into 15 buckets or fewer. 30s did that at HALF-second
// resolution (30/2 = 15, exactly full). 60s does NOT fit at half-seconds
// (60/2 = 30, which needs 5 bits), so the encoding moved to QUARTER-seconds:
// 60/4 = 15, again exactly full.
//
// WHY NOT JUST SPEND A BIT: the clientuimodel pool sits at 60 of a PROVEN 61-bit
// ceiling, and overflow is a map-load abort to the lobby, not a glitch. The last
// free bit is not worth a countdown's resolution.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS: the panel's timer now ticks in 4-second steps (60, 56, 52...)
// instead of 2. Keep TOD_CLS_TIMEOUT a multiple of 4 and <= 60, or the display
// truncates. tod_class_select.lua multiplies by 4 to decode — LOCKSTEP.
