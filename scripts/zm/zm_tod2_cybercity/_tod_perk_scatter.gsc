// _tod_perk_scatter.gsc — RANDOM PERK PLACEMENT + POST-BOSS RESHUFFLE
// (user 2026-08-20: perks "randomly placed at start of each map so each game
// is different... the round after each boss fight, 6,11,16,etc they will
// randomly shuffle... every perk will move from its spot into a new spot").
//
// PORTED from map 1's _acc_perk_scatter (the proven system, incl. its
// drop-in animation). Mechanically it RELOCATES the stock-spawned machine
// assemblies — stock perk_machine_spawn_init builds each machine out of 4
// script entities (t_use "zombie_vending" trigger, t_use.machine model,
// t_use.bump, t_use.clip) and everything downstream resolves BY NAME, so
// rewriting origins is safe (shipped precedent: zm_nuked, ohm-nabar).
//
// MAP 1 CORRECTNESS RULES PRESERVED (do not "simplify"):
//  - TWO-PHASE nav cut: ALL clips ConnectPaths at their old pads BEFORE any
//    move+DisconnectPaths — the calls are not refcounted; serializing
//    per-machine leaves a pad's navmesh open under a solid clip in any
//    permutation cycle (map 1 adversarial review, 3x confirmed).
//  - t.machine.b_keep_when_turned_off = true on every captured machine
//    EXCEPT Quick Revive (the stock solo 3-buy epilogue is the one live
//    turn_perk_off path; QR is FIXED to its base pad and keeps pure-stock
//    solo behavior).
//  - Only the visible MODEL glides in (MoveTo 0.8s from 60u up) — trigger/
//    bump/clip snap instantly, so the glide can never trap anyone.
//  - Host-based FX/SFX only (bare server PlayFX does not render — map 1's
//    five-module warning): burst rides a tag_origin host, sounds ride a
//    temp script_origin emitter.
//  - Anyone standing on an arrival pad is placed out the machine face.
//
// TOWER DELTAS vs map 1: pads > perks, so OPEN PADS ARE SHUFFLED TOO (map 1
// had equal counts; unshuffled pads would always fill lowest-index first);
// MULE KICK is excluded from capture (fixed roof machine); shuffle rounds =
// every 4th round (v10.3; was the round after each Panzer round); the
// pin/mega/glow/facing integrations are map-1 systems and are stripped.
//
// The 6 machines PARK along the base-arena N wall in the .map (generator) —
// if capture ever fails, they remain buyable there (graceful degradation).

	// QUICK REVIVE IS THE ONE CARVE-OUT (user 2026-08-20, the solo-safety
	// review): it is PINNED to the base arena, not a breather. Reaching the
	// floor-5 breather costs 9,375 points of doors, so pinning QR there left a
	// solo player with NO self-revive for ~10k points — one down ended the run.
	// The pad sits on the revive machine's own N-wall parking spot, so the
	// machine simply never moves. Every OTHER machine still scatters across
	// breathers only. (Granting the perk early is NOT an alternative: the stock
	// vending trigger refuses any buy while the player already holds the perk,
	// _zm_perks.gsc:545 — that would lock the player out of buying lives.)
	//
	// 9 pads / 9 MACHINES since 2026-08-25 — every pad is filled and each breather
	// carries TWO (user: "2 on each breather"). PhD Flopper was the ninth: it came
	// off the crown and into the scatter pool ("I dont want a perk on the crown"),
	// which is what closed the gap. Before that it was 8 machines, QR locked the
	// base and the other 7 shuffled into 8 breather pads, so ONE breather pad sat
	// empty every run and that breather had only one machine.
	//
	// KEEP THE COUNTS EQUAL. Adding a pad without a machine reopens the empty-pad
	// case; adding a machine without a pad leaves it parked at the base N wall,
	// which is the fallback row, not a bug — but it will not scatter.

	// this table was authored against front on model-local -Y; the BO7/BO6 port
	// meshes front on model-local +X — a +90 model-space rotation, so every
	// entity yaw comes DOWN 90 to keep the same WORLD facing. Measured, not

//
// READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" IT PROPERLY: this is a SELF-HEAL, not a diagnosis.
// Cherry's whole paper trail was walked and every link checks out —
//   * the .map struct is a script_struct / targetname zm_perk_machine carrying
//     model + script_noteworthy + the script_string that matches
//     "zclassic_perks_start_room", so perk_machine_spawn_init accepts it;
//   * that function builds the "zombie_vending" trigger UNCONDITIONALLY for any
//     accepted struct (_zm_perks.gsc:1511) — there is no perk-registration gate
//     on the trigger at all;
//   * register_perk_machine really does install ec_machine_setup as
//     .perk_machine_set_kvps, so the machine gets its unique radiant name and
//     the trigger gets .target pointing at it (stock leaves BOTH as
//     "vending_sleight" until that callback runs — that WOULD produce exactly
//     this symptom, and it is wired correctly);
//   * standard_powered_items registers every zombie_vending trigger it can see
//     at "start_zombie_round_logic", cherry included;
//   * and the turn_perk_off Delete-respawn trap — which strands our cached
//     t.machine — is already defused by b_keep_when_turned_off in
//     capture_and_open below.
//
// What the SYMPTOM proves regardless of cause: a machine MODEL and its USE
// TRIGGER ended up in different places. That is the only way to see a machine
// and have nothing to press. So rather than guess, enforce the invariant the
// scatter is supposed to maintain — trigger sits TOD_SCATTER_TRIG_Z above its
// machine — and re-align when it drifts.
//
// THE TRIGGER MOVES TO THE MACHINE, never the reverse: the model is what the
// player can see, so it is the source of truth for where the perk "is".
//
// QUICK REVIVE IS EXCLUDED and that exclusion is load-bearing: its solo
// epilogue (stock revive_solo_fx) deliberately FLIES THE MACHINE AWAY, so a
// drift check would chase the trigger into the sky.
//
// Under dev it prints what it found, which is the real point — one dev run now
// answers whether cherry drifts, never gets a machine, or was never captured.
